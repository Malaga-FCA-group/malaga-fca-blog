# Abstract


The notion of inclusion is a cornerstone in set theory and therefore, its generalization in fuzzy set theory is of great interest.The degree of f-inclusion is one generalization of such a notion that differs from others existing in the literature because the degree of inclusion is considered as a mapping instead of a value in the unit interval.On the other hand, the degree of f-weakcontradiction was introduced to represent the contradiction between two fuzzy sets via a mapping and its definition has many similarities with the f-degree of inclusion.This suggests the existence of relations between both f-degrees.Specifically, following this line, we analyze the relationship between the f-degree of inclusion and the f-degree of contradiction via the complement of fuzzy sets and Galois connections.
