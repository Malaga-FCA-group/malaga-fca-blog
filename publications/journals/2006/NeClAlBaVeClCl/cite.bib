  abstract = {The field of application of closure systems goes from theoretical areas as algebra or geometry to practical areas as databases and artificial intelligence. In these practical areas, a kind of constraint named functional dependencies have an important role. Given a set of attributes X and a set of functional dependencies 
$\Gamma$, the computation of the closure of $X$ for $\Gamma$, denoted as $X^+$ is abundantly used in artificial intelligence and database literature and is one of the key points in many problems: knowledge compilation, redundant constraint elimination, query optimization, the finding key problem, etc. We outline the main classical closure algorithms and we compare them with a novel algorithm named SLFD-Closure. We show an empirical study with the execution of the closure algorithms, and we establish that SLFD-Closure is the fastest.},
