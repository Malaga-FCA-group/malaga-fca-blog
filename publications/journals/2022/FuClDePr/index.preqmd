# Abstract

The aim of this paper is to extend closure systems from being crisp sets with certain fuzzy properties to proper fuzzy sets. The presentation of the paper shows a thorough discussion on the different alternatives that could be taken to define the desired fuzzy closure systems. These plausible alternatives are discarded if they are proven impossible to be in a bijective correspondence with closure operators. Finally, a definition of fuzzy closure system is established and a one-to-one relation with closure operators is proved.
