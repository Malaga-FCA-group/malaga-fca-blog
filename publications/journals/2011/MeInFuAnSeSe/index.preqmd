# Abstract


Recent approaches have shown that the measurement of the amount of inconsistent information contained in a logic theory can be useful to infer positive information. This paper deals with the definition of measures of inconsistency in the residuated-logic-programming paradigm under the fuzzy answer set semantics. This fuzzy framework provides a soft mechanism to control the amount of information inferred and, thus, controlling the inconsistencies by modifying slightly the truth values of some rules.
