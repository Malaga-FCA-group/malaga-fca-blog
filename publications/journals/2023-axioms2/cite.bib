ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the distribution characteristics of Fourier, discrete cosine, and discrete sine transform coefficients in T1 MRI images. This paper reveals their adherence to Benford&rsquo;s law, characterized by a logarithmic distribution of first digits. The impact of Rician noise on the first digit distribution is examined, which causes deviations from the ideal distribution. A novel methodology is proposed for noise level estimation, employing metrics such as the Bhattacharyya distance, Kullback&ndash;Leibler divergence, total variation distance, Hellinger distance, and Jensen&ndash;Shannon divergence. Supervised learning techniques utilize these metrics as regressors. Evaluations on MRI scans from several datasets coming from a wide range of different acquisition devices of 1.5 T and 3 T, comprising hundreds of patients, validate the adherence of noiseless T1 MRI frequency domain coefficients to Benford&rsquo;s law. Through rigorous experimentation, our methodology has demonstrated competitiveness with established noise estimation techniques, even surpassing them in numerous conducted experiments. This research empirically supports the application of Benford&rsquo;s law in transforms, offering a reliable approach for noise estimation in denoising algorithms and advancing image quality assessment.},
