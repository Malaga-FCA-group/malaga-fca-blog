# Abstract


This paper is an attempt at bridging two strains of research being developed by the authors: a theory of information flows to subserve intelligence and a theory of affordances for the modelling of Embodied, Embedded, Extended and Enacted Computational Intelligence as provided by FCA. We list previous successes, present challenges, and future avenues of research that suggest themselves.
