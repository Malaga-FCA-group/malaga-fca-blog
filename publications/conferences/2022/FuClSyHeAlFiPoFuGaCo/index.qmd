# Abstract


Galois connections are useful to model solutions for both pure and application-oriented problems. Throughout the paper, the general framework is a complete fuzzy lattice over a Heyting algebra. We have established a fuzzy Galois connection between the fuzzy powerset lattice and the set of functions in ùê¥. Furthermore, the fixed points, or formal concepts, of this fuzzy Galois connection are exactly the fuzzy closure systems and fuzzy closure operators on ùê¥. The extension of this fuzzy Galois connection to the general framework is discussed but the study of the fixed points is still an open problem.
