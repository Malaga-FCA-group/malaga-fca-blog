  abstract = {Partial formal contexts are trivalued contexts that, besides allowing to establish whether a property is satisfied or not, allow to represent situations in which there is ignorance about whether a property is satisfied. This can be useful, not only for the cases in which the modeled phenomenon has intrinsically unknown information, but also when summarizing information from a formal context by grouping similar rows. In this paper, we prospect for its extension including degrees of knowledge.},
