  abstract = {This paper generalises the tree-based data structure of Δ-tree to be applied to signed propositional formulas. The Δ-trees allow a compact representation for signed formulas as well as for a number of reduction strategies in order to consider only those occurrences of literals which are relevant for the satisfiability of the input formula. The conversions from signed formulas to Δ- trees and vice versa are described and a notion of restricted form based on this representation is introduced, allowing for a compact representation of formulas in order to consider only those occurrences of literals which are relevant for its satisfiability.},
