  abstract = {In this paper, we propose the use of a Functional Dependencies Data Dictionary (FD3) to facilitate the integration of Heterogeneous Systems. The heart of this approach is the notion of Functional Dependence (FD). We present a formal language, the Extended Functional Dependencies (EFD) Logic suitable to carry out integration tasks. The set of FDs contained in the data model is directly translated into a EFD logic theory. FD3 integrates the EFD logic sub-theories in a unique and unified EFD logic theory. EFD axiomatic system eases the design of automatic integration process. To communicate the information of the EFD logic theory, we introduce a High Level Functional Dependencies (HLFD) Data Model which is used in a similar way as the Entity/Relationship Model. The HLFD data model can be deduced automatically from EFD logic theory.},
