  abstract = {We introduce the notion of f-inclusion, which is used todescribe diﬀerent kinds of subsethood relations betweenfuzzy sets by means of monotonic functions f: [0,1] →[0,1]. We show that these monotonic functions can beconsidered indexes of inclusion, since the greater thefunction considered, the more restrictive is the relation-ship. Finally, we propose a general index of inclusion byproving the existence of a representative f-inclusion forany two ordered pairs of fuzzy sets. In such a way, ourapproach is diﬀerent from others in the literature in notaking a priori assumptions like residuated implicationsor t-norms.},
