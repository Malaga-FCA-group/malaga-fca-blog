  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to show a connection between FCA generalisations and the Chu construction on the category ChuCors, the category of formal contexts and Chu correspondences. All needed categorical properties like categorical product, tensor  product and its bifunctor properties are presented and proved. Finally, the second order generalisation of FCA is represented by a category built up in terms of the Chu construction.},
