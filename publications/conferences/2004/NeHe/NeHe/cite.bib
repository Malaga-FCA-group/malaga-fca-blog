  abstract = {In (Enciso and Mora, 2002) we introduce the Functional Dependencies Data Dictionary (F D3) as an architecture to facilitate the integration of database Systems. We propose the use of logics based on the notion of
Functional Dependencies (FD) to allows formal specification of the objects of a data model and to conceive
future automated treatment.
The existence of a FD logic provides a formal language suitable to carry out integration tasks and eases the
design of an automatic integration process based in the axiomatic system of the FD logic. Besides that, F D3,
provides a High Level Functional Dependencies (HLFD) Data Model which is used in a similar way as the
Entity/Relationship Model.
In this paper, we develop a CASE tool named A/D CASE (Attribute/Dependence CASE) that illustrates the
practical benefits of the F D3 architecture. In the development of A/D CASE we have taken into account other
theoretical results which improve our original F D3 proposal (Enciso and Mora, 2002). Particularly:
• A new functional dependencies logic named SLFD for removing redundancy in a database sub-model
that we present in (Mora, 2002; Cordero et al., 2002a). The use of SLFD add formalization to software
engineering process.
• An efficient preprocessing transformation based on the substitution paradigm that we present in (Mora et al.,
2003).
Unlike A/D CASE is independent from the Relational Model, it can be integrated into different database
systems and it is compatible with relational DBMSs.},
