  abstract = {The most popular basis in Formal Concept Analysis is the Duquenne-Guigues basis, which ensure minimality in the number of dependencies and it is built with pseudo-intents, and some method to calculate these basis from an arbitrary set of implications have been introduced. We propose in this paper, an automated method to calculate a left-minimal direct basis from the set of all implications built between a closed set and its corresponding minimal generators. The new basis also has the minimal property demanded in the Duquenne-Guigues basis. It is minimal in the cardinal of the set of implications, and minimal in the size of the left-hand side of the implications.},
