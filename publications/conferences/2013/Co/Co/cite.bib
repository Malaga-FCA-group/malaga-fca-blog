  abstract = {We continue our study of the general notion of L-Chu correspondence by introducing the category CRL-ChuCors incorporating
residuation to the underlying complete lattice L, specifically, on the basis of a residuation-preserving isotone Galois connection λ. Then, the L-bonds are generalized within this same framework, and its structure is related to that of the extent of a suitably defined λ-direct product.},
