  abstract = {The concept lattice corresponding to a context may be alternatively specified by means of attribute implications. One outstanding problem in formal concept analysis and other areas is the study of the equivalences between a given set of implications and its corresponding basis (notice that there exists a wide range of approaches to basis in the literature). In this work we introduce a method to provide a Duquenne-Guigues basis corresponding to the minimal generators and their closed sets from a context},
