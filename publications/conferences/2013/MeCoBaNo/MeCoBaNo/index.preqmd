# Abstract


In this work we elaborate on the notion of contradiction between fuzzy sets introduced by Trillas et al in a fuzzy logic context. Our approach is parametric in that the operator used to define contradiction is rather a variable than a constant introduced prior to the analysis of contradiction. We give several motivations to consider weaker operators than the usual involutive negations, and obtain some preliminary results which validate this proposal.
