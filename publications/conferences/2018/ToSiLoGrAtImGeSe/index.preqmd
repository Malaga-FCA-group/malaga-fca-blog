# Abstract


We present variant of simplification logic for reasoning with if-then dependencies that arise in formal concept analysis of data with
graded attributes. The dependencies and the proposed logic are parameterized by systems of isotone Galois connections which allows us to handle a large family of possible interpretations of data dependencies. We describe semantics of the rules, axiomatic system of the logic, and prove its soundness and completeness.
