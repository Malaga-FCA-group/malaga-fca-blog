# Abstract


In this paper we present a new technique for the analysis of data tables by means of Formal Independence Analysis (FIA). This is
an analogue of Formal Concept Analysis for the study of independence relations in data, instead of hierarchical relations. A FIA of a context produces, when possible, its block diagonalization by detecting pairs of sets of objects and attributes that are not mutually incident, or tomoi, that partition the context. In this paper we combine this technique with the exploration of contexts with entries in a semifield to find independent sets in contingency matrices. Specifically, we apply it to a number of confusion matrices issued from cognitive experiments to find evidences for the hypothesis of perceptual channels.
