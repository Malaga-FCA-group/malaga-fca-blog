# Abstract


Beyond the database normalization process, much work has been done on the use of functional dependencies
(FDs), their discovery using mining techniques, their use in query optimization and in the design of algorithms
dealing with the implication problem etc. Nevertheless, although much research expounds the benefits of using
functional dependencies, only a few modeling tools actually use them. In this work we present CBD, a new
software development tool which allows end users to specify their requirements. CBD allows the user to design
his/her own GUI for the application using forms and interface elements and it builds a meta-data dictionary
with information on functional dependencies. This data dictionary will be used to generate the unified data
model and a behavior model.
