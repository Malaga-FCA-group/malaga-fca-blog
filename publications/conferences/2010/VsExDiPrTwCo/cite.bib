  abstract = {We focus on the direct product of two L-fuzzy contexts, which are defined with the help of a binary operation on a lattice of truth-values L. This operation, essentially a disjunction, is defined as k ⋉ l = ¬k → l, for k, l ∈ L where negation is interpreted as ¬l = l → 0. We provide some results which extend previous work by Kr¨otzsch, Hitzler and Zhang.},
