# Abstract


Generalized concept lattices have been re-cently proposed to deal with uncertainty or incomplete information as a non-symmetric generalization of the theory of fuzzy for-mal concept analysis. On the other hand, concept lattices have been defined as well in the framework of fuzzy logics with non-commutative conjunctors. The contribution of this paper is to prove that any concept lattice for non-commutative fuzzy logic can be interpreted inside the framewok of generalized concept lattices, specifically, it is isomorphic to a sublattice of the cartesian product of two generalized concepts lattices.
