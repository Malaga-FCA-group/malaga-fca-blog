# Abstract


Image compression techniques have required much attention from the neural networks community for the last years. In this work we intend to develop a new algorithm to perform image compression based on adding some pre-fixed prototypes to those obtained by a competitive neural network. Prototypes are selected to get a better representation of the compressed image, improving the computational time needed to encode the image and decreasing the code-book storage necessities of the standard approach. This new method has been tested with some well-known images and results proved that our proposal outperforms classical methods in terms of maximizing peak-signal-to-noise-ratio values. © 2007 International Federation for Information Processing.
