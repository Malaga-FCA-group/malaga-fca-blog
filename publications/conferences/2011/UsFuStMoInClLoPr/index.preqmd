# Abstract


Based on the recently proved fact that the continuity of the connectives involved in a normal residuated logic program ensures the existence of fuzzy stable models, we focus on the assignment of a fuzzy stable model semantics to inconsistent classical logic programs on the basis of the separation of the notion of inconsistency and uncertainty.
