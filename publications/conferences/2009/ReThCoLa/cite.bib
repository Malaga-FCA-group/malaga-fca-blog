  abstract = {Formal concept analysis has become an important and appealing research topic. There exist a number of different fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis and of its representation theorem, which gives conditions for a complete lattice in order to be isomorphic to a concept lattice. In this paper we concentrate on the study of operational properties of the mappings α and β required in the representation theorem.},
