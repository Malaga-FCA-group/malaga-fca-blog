  abstract = {Starting with the underlying motivation of developing a general theory of L-fuzzy sets where L is a multilat- tice (a particular case of non-deterministic algebra), we study the relationship between the crisp notions of congruence, homomorphism and substructure on some non-deterministic algebras which have been used in the literature, i.e. hypergroups, and join spaces. Moreover, we provide suitable extensions of these notions to the fuzzy case.},
