  abstract = {We continue our study of the characterization of existence of adjunctions (isotone Galois connections) whose codomain is insufficiently structured. This paper focuses on the fuzzy case in which we have a fuzzy ordering ρA on A and a surjective mapping f : hA, ≈Ai → hB, ≈Bi compatible with respect to the fuzzy equivalences ≈A and ≈B. Specifically, the problem is to find a fuzzy ordering ρB and a compatible mappingg : hB, ≈Bi → hA, ≈Ai such that the pair (f, g) is a fuzzy adjunction.},
