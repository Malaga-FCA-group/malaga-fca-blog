  abstract = {In this work, we present a sound and complete axiomatic system for conditional attribute implications (CAI s) in Triadic Concept
Analysis (TCA). Our approach is strongly based on the Simplification paradigm which offers a more suitable way for automated reasoning than the one based on Armstrongâ€™s Axioms. We also present an automated method to prove the derivability of a CAI from a set of CAI s.},
