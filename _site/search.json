    "section": "",
    "text": "The work Regression of the Rician Noise Level in 3D Magnetic Resonance Images from the Distribution of the First Significant Digit has been published in Axioms, 12(12), 1117.\nAbstract:\nThis paper investigates the distribution characteristics of Fourier, discrete cosine, and discrete sine transform coefficients in T1 MRI images. This paper reveals their adherence to Benford’s law, characterized by a logarithmic distribution of first digits. The impact of Rician noise on the first digit distribution is examined, which causes deviations from the ideal distribution. A novel methodology is proposed for noise level estimation, employing metrics such as the Bhattacharyya distance, Kullback–Leibler divergence, total variation distance, Hellinger distance, and Jensen–Shannon divergence. Supervised learning techniques utilize these metrics as regressors. Evaluations on MRI scans from several datasets coming from a wide range of different acquisition devices of 1.5 T and 3 T, comprising hundreds of patients, validate the adherence of noiseless T1 MRI frequency domain coefficients to Benford’s law. Through rigorous experimentation, our methodology has demonstrated competitiveness with established noise estimation techniques, even surpassing them in numerous conducted experiments. This research empirically supports the application of Benford’s law in transforms, offering a reliable approach for noise estimation in denoising algorithms and advancing image quality assessment.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

    "text": "Abstract\nUncertainty, imprecision, inconsistency, or incompleteness are common factors to all sources of information found in practice; consequently, learning to deal with imperfect information is a prerequisite for the development of society. Proper use of imperfect information is essential not only in disciplines considered technical but also in the humanities. Our long-term vision is that both representation and management of imperfect information must have a solid formal foundation, and this naturally leads to the need of developing tools based on mathematics and logic. The expected progress of this project is the advancement of knowledge, providing formal foundations for certain specific areas selected for their current interest, according to an analysis of the recent literature on imperfect information.\nThe essential prerequisite for intelligently handling imperfect information is a good formal framework for representing and reasoning about it. A number of formal approaches for representing imperfect information, and several logics for reasoning about it, have been developed based on probability, possibility, plausibility measures, belief functions, fuzzy or rough set theory, or any combination of them. The main focus of this proposal is determined by our long-term vision. Certainly, in order to reach this long-term goal, the strategy should be established on a step-by-step basis. This project necessarily builds upon our previous research projects Fuzzy and Algebraic Computational Techniques for Society (FACTS) and Fuzzy, Logic and Algebraic tools for Information Resources (FLAIR), and inherits their general structure: from the mathematical foundations to the more logic-based approach.\nThis proposal has been designed upon the state-of-the-art on algebraic, logic, and fuzzy tools for the management of imperfect information, together with several discussions with researchers on related disciplines which led to a transversal vision of the approach needed to attempt this study. This analysis, which justifies the coherence of this proposal, led to the following conclusions:\n\nMany real-world problems are difficult to formalize by using classical methods, and a more general formal framework is needed in which approximate reasoning and/or incomplete information comes into play.\nFurther efforts need to be put on foundational research about imperfect information so that different approaches could be unified in terms of the abstraction of particular details and extracting the basic mechanism of execution.\nThis foundational research has to be necessarily done on a step-by-step basis. We will focus on specific topics in which our research team has proven proficiency, and we propose a scheme in which we will work in parallel in several lines: from the fundamental study of generalizations of FCA and its underlying categorial semantics to applications of the F-transform, and from fuzzy modal symbolic learning to the analysis of indexes of inclusion and contradiction in the multi-adjoint paradigm.\n\n\n\nMembers\nPrincipal Investigators: Manuel Ojeda-Aciego (PI1); Domingo López-Rodríguez (PI2)\nInvestigators: Carlos Bejines; Nicolás Madrid; Emilio Muñoz-Velasco\nCollaborators: Bernard De Baets; Ondrej Krídlo; Manuel Ojeda-Hernández; Irina Perfilieva; Marek Reformat; Guido Sciavicco\n\n\nHow to acknowledge\nInsert your name here acknowledge partial support by the project VALID (PID2022-140630NB-I00 funded by MCIN/ AEI/10.13039/501100011033).\n\n\nPublished works\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Fuzzy Vector Spaces as an Algebraic Framework for Flag Codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuzzy sets\n\n\n\nMathematics vol. 12 (3), article number 498.\n\n\n\n\n\n5 February 2024\n\n\nCarlos Bejines, Manuel Ojeda-Hernández, Domingo López-Rodríguez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregation Functions and Extent Structure Preservation in Formal Concept Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nAggregation operators\n\n\n\nInternational Conference on Conceptual Structures, LNCS 14133, pp. 28–35,\n\n\n\n\n\n12 September 2023\n\n\nCarlos Bejines, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Manuel Ojeda-Hernández\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregation Functions and Extent Structure Preservation in Formal Concept Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nAggregation operators\n\n\n\nInternational Conference on Conceptual Structures, LNCS 14133, pp. 28–35,\n\n\n\n\n\n12 September 2023\n\n\nCarlos Bejines, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Manuel Ojeda-Hernández\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting concept lattices with bonds induced by external information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nInformation Sciences, vol. 648, november 2023, article 119498\n\n\n\n\n\n3 August 2023\n\n\nOndrej Krídlo, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Lubomir Antoni, Peter Eliaš, Stanislav Krajči, Manuel Ojeda-Aciego\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Ambos problemas están incluidos en los desafíos sociales europeos y españoles.\nEn el contexto del cambio climático, se analizará el papel de la infraestructura verde en la mitigación del efecto isla de calor, teniendo en cuenta sus características y distribución geográfica. Se obtendrá un modelo para estudiar, en diferentes escenarios de cambio climático, los resultados esperados cuando se utilizan elementos de enverdecimiento urbano en las áreas más desfavorables.\nEn el contexto de la generación eléctrica, el objetivo principal de este proyecto es la generación de conocimiento, metodologías y procedimientos basados en técnicas de inteligencia artificial y minería de datos que permitan acercarse y dar solución a los desafíos que surgen en la gestión inteligente y automática de sistemas de autoconsumo fotovoltaico, incluido su mejor integración en la red eléctrica.\nPara garantizar que se alcanzan los objetivos planteados en el proyecto, éste debe ser desarrollado por un equipo multidisciplinar. Por un lado, es necesaria la participación de investigadores con experiencia en el desarrollo de nuevos algoritmos y modelos de minería de datos. Por otro lado, es necesaria la participación activa de investigadores en los dos campos de aplicación en los que trabajará el proyecto, es decir, investigadores en la integración de áreas verdes urbanas y la planificación del paisaje e investigadores en sistemas fotovoltaicos.\nFinalmente, en el plan de trabajo también se incluye la participación de un arquitecto y expertos en el mercado energético necesarios para el desarrollo de las aplicaciones que se proponen en el proyecto.\n\n\nPublished works\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection of unfavourable urban areas with higher temperatures and lack of green spaces using satellite imagery in sixteen Spanish cities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\n\nUrban Forestry & Urban Greening, vol. 78, 127783\n\n\n\n\n\n1 December 2022\n\n\nFrancisco Rodríguez-Gómez, Rafael Fernández-Cañero, Gabriel Pérez, José del Campo-Ávila, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Luis Pérez-Urrestarazu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

This is why we focus on specific topics in which our research team has proven proficiency, and we propose a scheme in which we will work in parallel in several lines.\nOur long-term vision should lead to a thorough formal theory of imperfect information, and the expected breakthrough towards this aim is the development of foundations for certain selected areas of interest, namely, the study of the mathematical and logic-based approaches to imperfect information, fuzzy inference systems using F-transform and measures of inconsistency, and a case study on Digital Forensics.\n\n\nPublished works\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Discovery in Malware Datasets using Formal Concept Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\n14th European Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n5 October 2022\n\n\nAngel Mora Bonilla, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Manuel Enciso, Pablo Cordero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfcaR, Formal Concept Analysis with R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nR package\n\n\n\nThe R Journal\n\n\n\n\n\n1 September 2022\n\n\nPablo Cordero, Manuel Enciso, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Ángel Mora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimal Generators from Positive and Negative Attributes: Analysing the Knowledge Space of a Mathematics Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nFuzzy logic\n\n\nE-learning\n\n\n\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, 15:58\n\n\n\n\n\n9 August 2022\n\n\nManuel Ojeda‐Hernández, Francisco Pérez‐Gámez, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Nicolás Madrid, Ángel Mora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing the Mixed Concept Lattice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nInternational Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n13 July 2022\n\n\nFrancisco Pérez-Gámez, Pablo Cordero, Manuel Enciso, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Angel Mora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMining Fuzzy Concept Lattices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nthe 22nd International Conference on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n4 July 2022\n\n\nManuel Ojeda-Hernández, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Ángel Mora, Pablo Cordero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfcaR, Spreading FCA to the Data Science World\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR package\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nWorkshop on Existing Tools and Applications for Formal Context Analysis 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n22 June 2022\n\n\nPablo Cordero, Manuel Enciso, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Ángel Mora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisiting Algorithms for Fuzzy Concept Lattices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nthe 16th International Conference on Concept Lattices and Applications 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n21 June 2022\n\n\nDomingo López-Rodríguez, Ángel Mora, Manuel Ojeda-Hernández\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplifying Implications with Positive and Negative Attributes: A Logic-Based Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nFuzzy logic\n\n\n\nMathematics, 10(4) 607\n\n\n\n\n\n16 February 2022\n\n\nFrancisco Pérez-Gámez, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Pablo Cordero, Ángel Mora, Manuel Ojeda-Aciego\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal methods in FCA and Big Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nBig data\n\n\n\nComplex Data Analytics with Formal Concept Analysis, pp. 201 – 224\n\n\n\n\n\n8 December 2021\n\n\nDomingo López Rodríguez, Emilio Muñoz Velasco, Manuel Ojeda Aciego\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic Modelling in Social Networks with Formal Concept Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nText mining\n\n\n\nInternational Conference on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering (CMMSE) 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n20 July 2021\n\n\nP.

This allows to process very high-dimensional data to obtain reliable estimations of the probability densities which are based on the PPCA framework.

An automated engine based on fuzzy Simplification Logic is proposed to make the suggestions to the users. Conversational recommender systems have proven to be a good approach in telemedicine, building a dialogue between the user and the recommender based on user preferences provided at each step of the conversation. Here, we propose a conversational recommender system for medical diagnosis using fuzzy logic. Specifically, fuzzy implications in the framework of Formal Concept Analysis are used to store the knowledge about symptoms and diseases and Fuzzy Simplification Logic is selected as an appropriate engine to guide the conversation to a final diagnosis. The recommender system has been used to provide differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and schizoaffective and bipolar disorders.

    "text": "Abstract\nIn this paper, two important issues concerning pattern recognition by neural networks are studied: a new model of hebbian learning, as well as the effect of the network capacity when retrieving patterns and performing clustering tasks. Particularly, an explanation of the energy function when the capacity is exceeded: the limitation in pattern storage implies that similar patterns are going to be identified by the network, therefore forming different clusters.\nThis ability can be translated as an unsupervised learning of pattern clusters, with one major advantage over most clustering algorithms: the number of data classes is automatically learned, as confirmed by the experiments. Two methods to reinforce learning are proposed to improve the quality of the clustering, by enhancing the learning of patterns relationships.\nAs a related issue, a study on the net capacity, depending on the number of neurons and possible outputs, is presented, and some interesting conclusions are commented.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[ML05] E.

In this paper, we analyse the use, inside this framework, of positive and negative (mixed) attributes of a dataset, which has proved to represent more information on the use of just positive attributes. From a theoretical point of view, in this paper we show the structure and the relationships between minimal generators of the simple and mixed concept lattices. From a practical point of view, the obtained theoretical results allow us to ensure a greater granularity in the retrieved information.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper seeks to identify the most unfavourable areas of a city in terms of high temperatures and the absence of green infrastructure. An automatic methodology based on remote sensing and data analysis has been developed and applied in sixteen Spanish cities with different characteristics. Landsat-8 satellite images were selected for each city from the July-August period of 2019 and 2020 to calculate the spatial variation of land surface temperature (LST). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to determine the abundance of vegetation across the city. Based on the NDVI and LST maps created, a k-means unsupervised classification clustering was performed to automatically identify the different clusters according to how favourable these areas were in terms of temperature and presence of vegetation. A Disadvantaged Area Index (DAI), combining both variables, was developed to produce a map showing the most unfavourable areas for each city. Overall, the percentage of the area susceptible to improvement with more vegetation in the cities studied ranged from 13 % in Huesca to 64–65 % in Bilbao and Valencia. The influence of several factors, such as the presence of water bodies or large buildings, is discussed. Detecting unfavourable areas is a very interesting tool for defining future planning strategy for green spaces.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURSUS-DM: Nuevos desarrollos en minería de datos para su utilización en la sostenibilidad urbana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData mining\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 September 2019\n\n\nDomingo López-Rodríguez\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCites\nThe following graph plots the number of cites received by this work from its publication, on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Rod+22] F.

    "text": "Abstract\nIn this sequel to our previous article (Cordero et al., 2020) on general inference systems for reasoning with if–then dependencies, we study transformations of if–then rules to semantically equivalent collections of if–then rules suitable to solve several problems related to reasoning with data dependencies. We work in a framework of general lattice-based if–then rules whose semantics is parameterized by systems of isotone Galois connections. This framework allows us to obtain theoretical insight as well as algorithms on a general level and observe their special cases by choosing various types of parameterizations. This way, we study methods for automated reasoning with different types of if–then rules in a single framework that covers existing as well as novel types of rules. Our approach supports a large family of if–then rules, including fuzzy if–then rules with various types of semantics. The main results in this article include new observations on the syntactic inference of if–then rules, complete collections of rules, reduced normal forms of collections of rules, and automated reasoning methods. We demonstrate the generality of the framework and the results by examples of their particular cases focusing on fuzzy if–then rules.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Cor+22] P.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe field of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) originated in the 1980s in Darmstadt, Germany, as a subfield of mathematical order theory, building on earlier research and developments by other groups. The original motivation for FCA was to explore complete lattices as lattices of concepts, drawing inspiration from both Philosophy and Mathematics. Over time, FCA has evolved into a broad research area with applications far beyond its initial focus, including but not limited to logic, knowledge representation, unsupervised learning, data mining, human learning, and psychology.\nThis volume features the contributions accepted for the 17th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis (ICFCA 2023), held during July 17 – 21, 2023, at University of Kassel, Germany. The International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis serves as a platform for researchers from FCA and related disciplines to showcase and exchange their research findings. Since its inaugural edition in 2003 in Darmstadt, Germany, ICFCA has been held annually in multiple locations across Europe, Africa, America, and Australia. In 2015, ICFCA became a biennial event to alternate with the Conference on Concept Lattices and Their Applications (CLA).\nThe previous edition, ICFCA 2021, organized by the Université de Strasbourg in France, was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that conditions are beginning to return to the pre-pandemic situation, this edition will once again offer face-to-face opportunities as well as an online mode for the audience, making this the first hybrid ICFCA edition.\nThis year’s ICFCA received 19 submissions from authors from ten countries. At least two different program committee members and one member of the editorial board reviewed each submission. Reviewing was done in a single-blinded fashion. Thirteen high-quality papers were selected for publication in this volume. This represents an acceptance rate of 67%.\nThe research part of this volume is divided into two distinct sections. First, in “Theory”, we have collected papers that propose and review advances in theoretical aspects of FCA. The second section, “Applications and Visualization”, consists of advances that deal with new algorithms, applications, and different approaches to visualization techniques.\nIn addition to the regular contributions, this volume also includes the abstracts of the six invited talks by outstanding researchers whom we were pleased to welcome to ICFCA 2023. In detail, we were pleased to host the following talks:\n\nHow to Visualize Sets and Set Relations by Oliver Deussen, Visual Computing, University of Konstanz, Germany\nTangles: from Wittgenstein to graph minors and back by Reinhard Diestel, Discrete Mathematics, University of Hamburg, Germany\nFormal Concept Analysis in Boolean Matrix Factorization: Algorithms and Extensions to Ordinal and Fuzzy-Valued Data by Jan Konečný, Department of Computer Science, Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic\nOn the \\varphi-degree of inclusion by Manuel Ojeda Aciego, Departmento de Matemática Aplicada, Universidad de Málaga, Spain\nLogical foundations of categorization theory by Alessandra Palmigiano, Department of Ethics, Governance and Society, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands\nModern Concepts of Dimension for Partially Ordered Sets by William T. Trotter, School of Mathematics, Georgia Tech Institute, USA\n\nMoreover, due to the recent computation of the ninth Dedekind number using techniques from FCA, this edition also includes a late-breaking result talk:\n\nBreaking the Barrier: A Computation of the Ninth Dedekind Number by Christian Jäkel, Methods of Applied Algebra, Dresden University of Technology, Germany\n\nWe are deeply grateful to all the authors who submitted their papers to ICFCA 2023 as a venue to present their work. Our sincere appreciation goes to the members of the Editorial Board and Program Committee, as well as all the additional reviewers, whose timely and thorough reviews enabled the fruitful discussions of the high quality papers during the conference. We would also like to express our gratitude to the local organizers who were always quick to solve any problems that arose. We are very grateful to Springer for supporting the International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis and to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and to the Research Center for Information System Design of the University of Kassel for hosting the event.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[DL23] D.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nMagnetic Resonance (MR) has a paramount dependence on the acquisition process, sometimes generating low-quality images useless for clinical diagnosis. One of the problems to be faced is the lack of enough resolution, which makes fine details of the brain inappreciable. Image Super-Resolution (SR) intends to solve an ill-posed problem to increase its resolution. The first approaches were based on the frequency and the spatial domain, extrapolating the high-frequency information from the low-resolution (LR) image, or regularization strategies, incorporating the prior knowledge of the unknown high-resolution (HR) image. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) has become the most competitive method to perform SR. Many models have been developed to enhance 2D slices only instead of using the 3D spatial information. This chapter begins with an introduction to the SR problem and goes over traditional and deep neural network models for 3D MR super-resolution. Finally, a compilation of the most recent methods is presented, compared quantitatively and qualitatively using the newest public datasets.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Dom+22] E.

    "text": "Abstract\nSince McCulloch and Pitts’ seminal work (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), several models of discrete neural networks have been proposed, many of them presenting the ability of assigning a discrete value (other than unipolar or bipolar) to the output of a single neuron. These models have focused on a wide variety of applications. One of the most important models was developed by J. Hopfield in (Hopfield, 1982), which has been successfully applied in fields such as pattern and image recognition and reconstruction (Sun et al., 1995), design of analogdigital circuits (Tank & Hopfield, 1986), and, above all, in combinatorial optimization (Hopfield & Tank, 1985) (Takefuji, 1992) (Takefuji & Wang, 1996), among others. The purpose of this work is to review some applications of multivalued neural models to combinatorial optimization problems, focusing specifically on the neural model MREM, since it includes many of the multivalued models in the specialized literature.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[CLO09] E.

It defines two explicit representations of the knowledge present in a dataset as concepts and implications. This paper describes an R package called fcaR that implements FCA’s core notions and techniques. Additionally, it implements the extension of FCA to fuzzy datasets and a simplification logic to develop automated reasoning tools. This package is the first to implement FCA techniques in R. Therefore, emphasis has been put on defining classes and methods that could be reusable and extensible by the community. Furthermore, the package incorporates an interface with the arules package, probably the most used package regarding association rules, closely related to FCA.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe Mixture of Probabilistic Principal Components Analyzers (MPPCA) is a multivariate analysis technique which defines a Gaussian probabilistic model at each unit. The number of units and principal directions in each unit is not learned in the original approach. Variational Bayesian approaches have been proposed for this purpose, which rely on assumptions on the input distribution and/or approximations of certain statistics.

The aim of this technique is to reduce the number of local minima of the objective function, allowing the net to improve considerably the quality of the obtained solutions. Most discrete neural networks can benefit from its application, due to its generality and ease of use. We also propose its theoretical bases, and its application to recurrent neural networks is shown. To this end, Traveling Salesman Problem has been used as benchmark for this technique, as it is the best-known combinatorial optimization problem and the most used benchmark to quantify the efficiency of algorithms applied to this kind of problems. This new method has been compared to other techniques in terms of average solution quality, showing a substantial improvement. It is also able, in most of the performed simulations, to reach solutions near to global optimum.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[LM05] D. López-Rodríguez and E.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIsomorphism identification between graphs is an important NP-complete problem with many science and engineering applications. Although excellent progresses have been made towards special graphs, no known polynomial-time algorithm for graph isomorphism has been found for general graphs. In this paper a generalization of the Hopfield neural network for isomorphism identification between general graphs is proposed. Simulation results show that this model is much superior to recently presented neural networks for this problem. The effectiveness of the resultant network does not seem to be decreased as the size of the graph is increased. This allows us to solve graph isomorphism problems with a big number of vertices, while many recently presented approaches only present results for graphs with up to 15 vertices.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[GLM08] G.

A detailed description of the model is presented, and the technique to minimize an energy function is fully described. It has proved to be a very competitive and efficient algorithm, in terms of quality of solutions and computational time, when compared to the state-of-the-art heuristic methods specifically designed for this problem. Some simulation results are presented in this paper, to show the comparative efficiency of the methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.\n\n\nCites\nThe following graph plots the number of cites received by this work from its publication, on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Lóp+07] D.
