    "text": "Abstract\nUncertainty, imprecision, inconsistency, or incompleteness are common factors to all sources of information found in practice; consequently, learning to deal with imperfect information is a prerequisite for the development of society. Proper use of imperfect information is essential not only in disciplines considered technical but also in the humanities. Our long-term vision is that both representation and management of imperfect information must have a solid formal foundation, and this naturally leads to the need of developing tools based on mathematics and logic. The expected progress of this project is the advancement of knowledge, providing formal foundations for certain specific areas selected for their current interest, according to an analysis of the recent literature on imperfect information.\nThe essential prerequisite for intelligently handling imperfect information is a good formal framework for representing and reasoning about it. A number of formal approaches for representing imperfect information, and several logics for reasoning about it, have been developed based on probability, possibility, plausibility measures, belief functions, fuzzy or rough set theory, or any combination of them. The main focus of this proposal is determined by our long-term vision. Certainly, in order to reach this long-term goal, the strategy should be established on a step-by-step basis. This project necessarily builds upon our previous research projects Fuzzy and Algebraic Computational Techniques for Society (FACTS) and Fuzzy, Logic and Algebraic tools for Information Resources (FLAIR), and inherits their general structure: from the mathematical foundations to the more logic-based approach.\nThis proposal has been designed upon the state-of-the-art on algebraic, logic, and fuzzy tools for the management of imperfect information, together with several discussions with researchers on related disciplines which led to a transversal vision of the approach needed to attempt this study. This analysis, which justifies the coherence of this proposal, led to the following conclusions:\n\nMany real-world problems are difficult to formalize by using classical methods, and a more general formal framework is needed in which approximate reasoning and/or incomplete information comes into play.\nFurther efforts need to be put on foundational research about imperfect information so that different approaches could be unified in terms of the abstraction of particular details and extracting the basic mechanism of execution.\nThis foundational research has to be necessarily done on a step-by-step basis. We will focus on specific topics in which our research team has proven proficiency, and we propose a scheme in which we will work in parallel in several lines: from the fundamental study of generalizations of FCA and its underlying categorial semantics to applications of the F-transform, and from fuzzy modal symbolic learning to the analysis of indexes of inclusion and contradiction in the multi-adjoint paradigm.\n\n\n\nMembers\nPrincipal Investigators: Manuel Ojeda-Aciego (PI1); Domingo López-Rodríguez (PI2)\nInvestigators: Carlos Bejines; Nicolás Madrid; Emilio Muñoz-Velasco\nCollaborators: Bernard De Baets; Ondrej Krídlo; Manuel Ojeda-Hernández; Irina Perfilieva; Marek Reformat; Guido Sciavicco\n\n\nHow to acknowledge\nInsert your name here acknowledge partial support by the project VALID (PID2022-140630NB-I00 funded by MCIN/ AEI/10.13039/501100011033).\n\n\nPublished works\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregation Functions and Extent Structure Preservation in Formal Concept Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nAggregation operators\n\n\n\nInternational Conference on Conceptual Structures, LNCS 14133, pp. 28–35,\n\n\n\n\n\n12 September 2023\n\n\nCarlos Bejines, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Manuel Ojeda-Hernández\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting concept lattices with bonds induced by external information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nInformation Sciences, vol. 648, november 2023, article 119498\n\n\n\n\n\n3 August 2023\n\n\nOndrej Krídlo, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Lubomir Antoni, Peter Eliaš, Stanislav Krajči, Manuel Ojeda-Aciego\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper aims populational modeling of volumetric degeneration of the gray matter due to Alzheimer’s disease, to establish the parameters of degeneration, and to contrast the state of an individual with respect to that model. In this way, you can get an early diagnosis of the disease. We have used 2100 structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI), classified by sex (1097 M/1003 F), and corresponding to healthy people (C, Controls) and with Dementia (AD, Alzheimer’s Disease), between 18 and 96 años (M-C 59.44±24, F-C 60.75±22.79/ M-AD 75.35±7.07, F-C 74.23±8.02), from public domain databases. The SMRI processing methodology uses filtering, segmentation algorithms, and the calculation of parameters such as cortical thickness or volume. Furthermore, registration was performed on each subject with a standard template and a 116 anatomical structures atlas in which the above parameters are calculated. It was possible to establish which structural changes the brain undergoes when affected by Alzheimer’s disease, according to criteria of loss of volume or gray matter thickness, relative to healthy subjects paracentral lobe, angular gyrus, calcarine sulcus (p&lt;0.001), among others. some rules Have also been developed for classifying (error &lt;9%) a given subject as normal or with Alzheimer with a given probability. We generated a model of Alzheimer’s disease, using statistical techniques and imaging processing.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nFormal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for analysing data tables that capture the relationship between objects and attributes. The concept lattice derived from such a table is a representation of the implicit knowledge about this relationship, where each concept corresponds to a bicluster of objects and attributes. FCA has been widely used for knowledge acquisition and representation, conceptual data analysis, information retrieval and other applications. In this paper, we use an extension of the classical FCA to deal with fuzzy formal contexts, where the relationship between objects and attributes is modelled by truth values indicating the degree to which an object possesses a property or attribute. Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA) allows us to capture vague or imprecise information and handle uncertainty or ambiguity in data analysis. Our purpose is to use aggregation functions in order to manipulate and explore fuzzy formal concepts in different ways depending on the desired properties or criteria. In this work, we will focus on the structure of the extents of the concept lattice. We define the aggregation of fuzzy extents point-wise and study how it affects its structure. We characterise the aggregation functions that preserve the fuzzy extent structure and show that they depend on the number of objects in the context. Our results contribute to a better understanding of how aggregation functions can be used to manipulate and explore fuzzy formal concepts.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVALID: Verifiable Algebraic and Logic tools for Imperfect Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Concept Analysis\n\n\nFuzzy Logic\n\n\nUncertainty\n\n\nImprecise information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 September 2023\n\n\nManuel Ojeda-Aciego, Domingo López-Rodríguez\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[BLO23] C.

    "title": "Topic Modelling in Social Networks with Formal Concept Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn the age of social networks, the amount of the written material published every day exceeds our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organise and to understand extensive collections of unstructured text documents. In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a statistical model for discovering the abstract ‘’topics’’ in a collection of documents, uncovering hidden semantic structures and clusters of similar words. Topic modelling formalises this idea mathematically in a framework that allows discovering the topics and each document’’s balance of topics. One of the first topic models was latent semantic indexing. Later, the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) was presented, serving as a basis for many others. Notably, its extension latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is one of the most common topic model currently in use. To approach topic modelling in social networks, we use Formal Concept Analysis, a mathematical tool firmly based on lattice theory and logic. Our approach uses the knowledge contained in the concept lattice to extract the topics. Thus, this approach to topic modelling is not statistical. For example, we do not need to assume a prior distribution of terms. Instead, the actual data structure is used to infer the semantic relationships between attributes. The procedure is as follows: a formal context is built from the document-term matrix of the set of documents. Then, we use FCA tools to construct the concept lattice that contains, in each concept, knowledge about the topics in the documents. Once this lattice is built, the concepts are clustered. Concept clusters are then used to induce topic models on the original documents. An experiment with a dataset with tweets about some hashtags is conducted with our approach to show how Formal Concept Analysis can be used in Social Network Analysis. In addition, a comparison with classical techniques is being addressed.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAIR: Fuzzy, Logic and Algebraic tools for Information Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Concept Analysis\n\n\nFuzzy Logic\n\n\nUncertainty\n\n\nImprecise information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 September 2019\n\n\nManuel Ojeda Aciego, Nicolás Madrid Labrador\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nOne of the hot topics in clinical research is hidden knowledge discovery in datasets with a high number of features (variables or attributes). We approach how to provide recommendations in Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) to guide the experts in the diagnostic process. The dataset used for this work is an openly sharing neuroimaging data from 1100 subjects with 162 graded attributes, that is, features with a degree of certainty. The knowledge retrieved from the dataset is shaped like graded implications which will be manipulated using some automated methods based on logic. These methods guide the experts in the diagnostic process establishing a recommendation. In this paper, we work under the Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) framework. The first result is the mining of the graded implications from the dataset using the NEXTCLOSURE for Graded Attributes. The problem of reasoning with these graded implications is approached with the so-called Fuzzy Attribute Simplification Logic. This logic leads to some automatic reasoning methods for implications in data with grades. As the number of graded implications mined from the fuzzy formal context is huge and with a high degree of redundancy, the objective is to obtain a equivalent set without redundancy, by applying the rules of our logic. Finally, we approach the medical diagnosis problem in datasets with graded attributes using FASL to obtain a CDSS system, being able to offer the expert a recommendation about the diagnosis process. We propose to use SLFD attribute closure algorithm as the engine for the recommendation system based on features (symptoms, phenotypes, signs) of the items (diseases) in the dataset.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAIR: Fuzzy, Logic and Algebraic tools for Information Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Concept Analysis\n\n\nFuzzy Logic\n\n\nUncertainty\n\n\nImprecise information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 September 2019\n\n\nManuel Ojeda Aciego, Nicolás Madrid Labrador\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIntelligent malware detection is a problem that is generating growing interest in the industry due to the increase in the diversity of threats and attacks suffered by small users to large organisations or governments, in many cases compromising sensitive information and without ruling out possible economic consequences.\nAmong the different problems that arise in this area, the homogenisation of the nomenclature of malware threats stands out, as different antivirus engines or applications often use different names for the same threat or the same family of threats, which is related to the problem of malware family classification.\nAnother big open problem in this field is the definition of methodologies that allow optimising the detection process itself of new threats, since the different engines have different detection capabilities and no single software can detect all the threats at one point, thus there is a need of determining which combination or possible combinations of engines cover the majority of detection and which features present in malicious software allow us to detect it at an early stage.\nIn this paper, we propose the use of formal concept analysis (FCA) to exploit the existing knowledge in previous threat and malware databases by different detection engines. In this formal framework, based on lattice theory and logic, we can build a lattice where threat sets are organised hierarchically according to specialisation-generalisation criteria, which provides us with a direct approach to setting up a unified taxonomy of malware.\nOn the other hand, the use of FCA itself enables the discovery of logical rules and the application of automated reasoning methods whose objective is to simplify the detection process without losing information or threat detection capacity and even increasing this capacity.\nIn this sense, our proposal differs from previous ones in that it does not use statistical criteria, but rather an exhaustive analysis and mathematical modelling of the knowledge contained in malware databases, so that the models obtained are based on logical and algebraic tools and offer a greater degree of interpretability and explainability than previous proposals.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAIR: Fuzzy, Logic and Algebraic tools for Information Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Concept Analysis\n\n\nFuzzy Logic\n\n\nUncertainty\n\n\nImprecise information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 September 2019\n\n\nManuel Ojeda Aciego, Nicolás Madrid Labrador\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Bon+22] A.

We explain the model and establish a relation between vector quantization and sum-of-squares clustering. To test the efficiency of this model as vector quantifier, we apply this new technique to image compression. Two well-known images are used as benchmark, allowing us to compare our model to standard competitive learning.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nOne of the ways to represent the implicit knowledge in a binary dataset under the paradigm of Formal Concept Analysis is the concept lattice. This lattice allows describing a hierarchical biclustering between objects and attributes of a formal context. Concepts are the fixed points of a Galois connection, describing a closure system. In practice, the computation of such lattice presents a high complexity, the number of concepts can be exponential in the size of the input context. Therefore, there is interest in developing new algorithms that take advantage of the lattice structure to efficiently compute the concept set. Thus, many algorithms have been proposed to compute the concept lattice in this binary setting in the last years. To avoid the complete enumeration of subsets to check which of them are closed, some pruning strategies have been proposed. For example, the NextClosure algorithm defines a lectic order in which to explore closed sets. Other strategies are based on a recursive tree search accompanied by canonicity tests that allow a more efficient exploration. Those based on the CbO strategy, such as FastCbO (FCbO), or InClose stand out. It is possible to extend this framework to take into account the different degrees to which an attribute could be present in an object. Through this extension, it is possible to model fuzzy situations where the attribute is not 100% present in an object, giving flexibility to the model. In this paper, we extend the previous algorithms for the calculation of the fuzzy concept lattice. We show how the InClose family of algorithms can be extended from the binary setting to the fuzzy one, detailing the differences and how new canonicity tests can be employed in order to reduce the computational cost of determining the set of concepts. We show that these new algorithms can compete with the state of the art in terms of execution time and in number of operations performed. These algorithms may open a new research line in which optimised algorithms can be deduced and built ad hoc for the computation of the fuzzy concept lattice.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAIR: Fuzzy, Logic and Algebraic tools for Information Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Concept Analysis\n\n\nFuzzy Logic\n\n\nUncertainty\n\n\nImprecise information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 September 2019\n\n\nManuel Ojeda Aciego, Nicolás Madrid Labrador\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nImage compression techniques have required much attention from the neural networks community for the last years. In this work we intend to develop a new algorithm to perform image compression based on adding some pre-fixed prototypes to those obtained by a competitive neural network. Prototypes are selected to get a better representation of the compressed image, improving the computational time needed to encode the image and decreasing the code-book storage necessities of the standard approach. This new method has been tested with some well-known images and results proved that our proposal outperforms classical methods in terms of maximizing peak-signal-to-noise-ratio values. © 2007 International Federation for Information Processing.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[CLO07] E.

En este sentido, el modelo aquí presentado sostiene que aunque la capacidad de la red debe ser interpretada como una limitación de la red para aprender patrones individuales, cuando se sobrepasa dicha capacidad, la red tiende a identificar patrones similares formando grupos en torno a representantes típicos. Así, lo que en realidad se produce es el aprendizaje no supervisado de clases de patrones. De esta forma mediante la generalización del aprendizaje hebbiano aquí mostrado, pueden aprenderse grupos de patrones (conceptos) en lugar de patrones individuales y esto ocurre generalmente cuando se sobrepasa la capacidad de la red. Nuestro modelo presenta dos grandes ventajas sobre los algoritmos de clasificación típicos, no es necesario el ajuste de ningún parámetro, e incluso el numero de clases de patrones se aprende automáticamente, de forma que no hace falta ningún tipo de conocimiento a priori sobre el número de clases.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[ML05] E.

Evaluations on MRI scans from several datasets coming from a wide range of different acquisition devices of 1.5 T and 3 T, comprising hundreds of patients, validate the adherence of noiseless T1 MRI frequency domain coefficients to Benford’s law. Through rigorous experimentation, our methodology has demonstrated competitiveness with established noise estimation techniques, even surpassing them in numerous conducted experiments. This research empirically supports the application of Benford’s law in transforms, offering a reliable approach for noise estimation in denoising algorithms and advancing image quality assessment.},    DOI = {10.3390/axioms12121117}}"

    "text": "Abstract\nGraded implications in the framework of Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis are used as the knowledge guiding the recommendations. An automated engine based on fuzzy Simplification Logic is proposed to make the suggestions to the users. Conversational recommender systems have proven to be a good approach in telemedicine, building a dialogue between the user and the recommender based on user preferences provided at each step of the conversation. Here, we propose a conversational recommender system for medical diagnosis using fuzzy logic. Specifically, fuzzy implications in the framework of Formal Concept Analysis are used to store the knowledge about symptoms and diseases and Fuzzy Simplification Logic is selected as an appropriate engine to guide the conversation to a final diagnosis. The recommender system has been used to provide differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and schizoaffective and bipolar disorders. In addition, we have enriched the conversational strategy with two strategies (namely critiquing and elicitation mechanism) for a better understanding of the knowledge-driven conversation, allowing user’s feedback in each step of the conversation and improving the performance of the method.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAIR: Fuzzy, Logic and Algebraic tools for Information Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Concept Analysis\n\n\nFuzzy Logic\n\n\nUncertainty\n\n\nImprecise information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 September 2019\n\n\nManuel Ojeda Aciego, Nicolás Madrid Labrador\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCites\nThe following graph plots the number of cites received by this work from its publication, on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Cor+20] P.

Several SOMs have been proposed in the literature to capture the local principal subspaces, but our approach offers a probabilistic model while it has a low complexity on the dimensionality of the input space. This allows to process very high-dimensional data to obtain reliable estimations of the probability densities which are based on the PPCA framework. Experimental results are presented, which show the map formation capabilities of the proposal with high-dimensional data, and its potential in image and video compression applications.\n\n\nCites\nThe following graph plots the number of cites received by this work from its publication, on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[LOL09] E.

    "text": "Abstract\nDetection of isomorphism among kinematic chains is essential in mechanical design, but difficult and computationally expensive. It has been shown that both traditional methods and previously presented neural networks still have a lot to be desired in aspects such as simplifying procedure of identification and adapting automatic computation. Therefore, a new algorithm based on a competitive Hopfield network is developed for automatic computation in the kinematic chain isomorphism problem. The neural approach provides directly interpretable solutions and does not demand tuning of parameters. We have tested the algorithm by solving problems reported in the recent mechanical literature. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the network that rapidly identifies isomorphic kinematic chains.\n\n\nCites\nThe following graph plots the number of cites received by this work from its publication, on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[GML07] G.

We work in a framework of general lattice-based if–then rules whose semantics is parameterized by systems of isotone Galois connections. This framework allows us to obtain theoretical insight as well as algorithms on a general level and observe their special cases by choosing various types of parameterizations. This way, we study methods for automated reasoning with different types of if–then rules in a single framework that covers existing as well as novel types of rules. Our approach supports a large family of if–then rules, including fuzzy if–then rules with various types of semantics. The main results in this article include new observations on the syntactic inference of if–then rules, complete collections of rules, reduced normal forms of collections of rules, and automated reasoning methods. We demonstrate the generality of the framework and the results by examples of their particular cases focusing on fuzzy if–then rules.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Cor+22] P.

    "text": "Abstract\nSince McCulloch and Pitts’ seminal work (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), several models of discrete neural networks have been proposed, many of them presenting the ability of assigning a discrete value (other than unipolar or bipolar) to the output of a single neuron. These models have focused on a wide variety of applications. One of the most important models was developed by J. Hopfield in (Hopfield, 1982), which has been successfully applied in fields such as pattern and image recognition and reconstruction (Sun et al., 1995), design of analogdigital circuits (Tank & Hopfield, 1986), and, above all, in combinatorial optimization (Hopfield & Tank, 1985) (Takefuji, 1992) (Takefuji & Wang, 1996), among others. The purpose of this work is to review some applications of multivalued neural models to combinatorial optimization problems, focusing specifically on the neural model MREM, since it includes many of the multivalued models in the specialized literature.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[CLO09] E.

They emphasize the use of direct bases in several problems, where a large number of closures are needed. The more efficient the basis computation is, the better performance the methods solving these problems has. Here, we propose a new method, named SLgetdo, to calculate the direct-optimal basis. The main characteristic of SLgetdo is the full integration of simplification paradigm, providing a limited rise of the implicational set throughout its execution. We have showed the better behavior of SLgetdo in an empirical experiment. The general conclusion is that it improves the performance of previous methods, providing a better management of time and space resources.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

Using the framework of formal concept analysis, particularly the notion of implication between attributes, we propose a method strongly based on logic which allows to manage the users’ preferences by following a conversational paradigm. Concerning complexity, to build the conversation and provide updated information based on the users’ previous actions (choices) the method has polynomial delay.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

At the same time, Governments have designed a set of measures to deal with the Pandemic. In addition, several institutions have studied the economical effects of the situation in each country. In this work, we combine these three data sources and illustrate how Formal Concept Analysis can become a useful tool to discover relationships among these three views of the situation: health, politics and economy.

The use of FCA in the context of big data provides a basis for better interpretability and explainability of results, usually lacking in other statistical approaches to data analysis; however, scalability is an important issue for FCA logic-based tools and techniques, such as the generation and use of implicational systems. We survey the theoretical and technical foundations of some trends in FCA. Specifically, we present a summary of promising theoretical and practical applications of FCA that could be used to solve the problem of dealing with big data.

El propósito de esta versión estocástica es el de evitar ciertos mínimos locales de la función objetivo minimizada por la red, esto es, la función de energía. Con este fin, describimos las bases teóricas de este nuevo modelo, que nos garantizan la convergencia de la red a un mínimo local, de una forma rigurosa. Para mostrar la eficiencia de esta versión, el modelo, en ambas versiones, determinista y estocástica, ha sido aplicado para resolver el ya conocido problema de la partición de un grafo, MaxCut.

    "text": "The work Formal Concept Analysis has been published in 17th International Conference, ICFCA 2023, Kassel, Germany, July 17-21, 2023, Proceedings.\nAbstract:\nThe field of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) originated in the 1980s in Darmstadt, Germany, as a subfield of mathematical order theory, building on earlier research and developments by other groups. The original motivation for FCA was to explore complete lattices as lattices of concepts, drawing inspiration from both Philosophy and Mathematics. Over time, FCA has evolved into a broad research area with applications far beyond its initial focus, including but not limited to logic, knowledge representation, unsupervised learning, data mining, human learning, and psychology.\nThis volume features the contributions accepted for the 17th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis (ICFCA 2023), held during July 17 – 21, 2023, at University of Kassel, Germany. The International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis serves as a platform for researchers from FCA and related disciplines to showcase and exchange their research findings. Since its inaugural edition in 2003 in Darmstadt, Germany, ICFCA has been held annually in multiple locations across Europe, Africa, America, and Australia. In 2015, ICFCA became a biennial event to alternate with the Conference on Concept Lattices and Their Applications (CLA).\nThe previous edition, ICFCA 2021, organized by the Université de Strasbourg in France, was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that conditions are beginning to return to the pre-pandemic situation, this edition will once again offer face-to-face opportunities as well as an online mode for the audience, making this the first hybrid ICFCA edition.\nThis year’s ICFCA received 19 submissions from authors from ten countries. At least two different program committee members and one member of the editorial board reviewed each submission. Reviewing was done in a single-blinded fashion. Thirteen high-quality papers were selected for publication in this volume. This represents an acceptance rate of 67%.\nThe research part of this volume is divided into two distinct sections. First, in “Theory”, we have collected papers that propose and review advances in theoretical aspects of FCA. The second section, “Applications and Visualization”, consists of advances that deal with new algorithms, applications, and different approaches to visualization techniques.\nIn addition to the regular contributions, this volume also includes the abstracts of the six invited talks by outstanding researchers whom we were pleased to welcome to ICFCA 2023. In detail, we were pleased to host the following talks:\n\nHow to Visualize Sets and Set Relations by Oliver Deussen, Visual Computing, University of Konstanz, Germany\nTangles: from Wittgenstein to graph minors and back by Reinhard Diestel, Discrete Mathematics, University of Hamburg, Germany\nFormal Concept Analysis in Boolean Matrix Factorization: Algorithms and Extensions to Ordinal and Fuzzy-Valued Data by Jan Konečný, Department of Computer Science, Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic\nOn the \\varphi-degree of inclusion by Manuel Ojeda Aciego, Departmento de Matemática Aplicada, Universidad de Málaga, Spain\nLogical foundations of categorization theory by Alessandra Palmigiano, Department of Ethics, Governance and Society, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands\nModern Concepts of Dimension for Partially Ordered Sets by William T. Trotter, School of Mathematics, Georgia Tech Institute, USA\n\nMoreover, due to the recent computation of the ninth Dedekind number using techniques from FCA, this edition also includes a late-breaking result talk:\n\nBreaking the Barrier: A Computation of the Ninth Dedekind Number by Christian Jäkel, Methods of Applied Algebra, Dresden University of Technology, Germany\n\nWe are deeply grateful to all the authors who submitted their papers to ICFCA 2023 as a venue to present their work. Our sincere appreciation goes to the members of the Editorial Board and Program Committee, as well as all the additional reviewers, whose timely and thorough reviews enabled the fruitful discussions of the high quality papers during the conference. We would also like to express our gratitude to the local organizers who were always quick to solve any problems that arose. We are very grateful to Springer for supporting the International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis and to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and to the Research Center for Information System Design of the University of Kassel for hosting the event.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

    "text": "The work Topic Modelling in Social Networks with Formal Concept Analysis has been published in International Conference on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering (CMMSE) 2021.\nAbstract:\nIn the age of social networks, the amount of the written material published every day exceeds our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organise and to understand extensive collections of unstructured text documents. In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a statistical model for discovering the abstract ‘’topics’’ in a collection of documents, uncovering hidden semantic structures and clusters of similar words. Topic modelling formalises this idea mathematically in a framework that allows discovering the topics and each document’’s balance of topics. One of the first topic models was latent semantic indexing. Later, the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) was presented, serving as a basis for many others. Notably, its extension latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is one of the most common topic model currently in use. To approach topic modelling in social networks, we use Formal Concept Analysis, a mathematical tool firmly based on lattice theory and logic. Our approach uses the knowledge contained in the concept lattice to extract the topics. Thus, this approach to topic modelling is not statistical. For example, we do not need to assume a prior distribution of terms. Instead, the actual data structure is used to infer the semantic relationships between attributes. The procedure is as follows: a formal context is built from the document-term matrix of the set of documents. Then, we use FCA tools to construct the concept lattice that contains, in each concept, knowledge about the topics in the documents. Once this lattice is built, the concepts are clustered. Concept clusters are then used to induce topic models on the original documents. An experiment with a dataset with tweets about some hashtags is conducted with our approach to show how Formal Concept Analysis can be used in Social Network Analysis. In addition, a comparison with classical techniques is being addressed.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

These models have focused on a wide variety of applications. One of the most important models was developed by J. Hopfield in (Hopfield, 1982), which has been successfully applied in fields such as pattern and image recognition and reconstruction (Sun et al., 1995), design of analogdigital circuits (Tank & Hopfield, 1986), and, above all, in combinatorial optimization (Hopfield & Tank, 1985) (Takefuji, 1992) (Takefuji & Wang, 1996), among others.

In particular, two main problems that it possesses: the apparition of spurious patterns in the learning phase, implying the well-known effect of storing the opposite pattern, and the problem of its reduced capacity, meaning that it is not possible to store a great amount of patterns without increasing the error probability in the retrieving phase. In this paper, a method to avoid spurious patterns is presented and studied, and an explanation of the previously mentioned effect is given. Another technique to increase the capacity of a network is proposed here, based on the idea of using several reference points when storing patterns. It is studied in depth, and an explicit formula for the capacity of the network with this technique is provided.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

We approach how to provide recommendations in Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) to guide the experts in the diagnostic process. The dataset used for this work is an openly sharing neuroimaging data from 1100 subjects with 162 graded attributes, that is, features with a degree of certainty. The knowledge retrieved from the dataset is shaped like graded implications which will be manipulated using some automated methods based on logic. These methods guide the experts in the diagnostic process establishing a recommendation. In this paper, we work under the Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) framework. The first result is the mining of the graded implications from the dataset using the NEXTCLOSURE for Graded Attributes. The problem of reasoning with these graded implications is approached with the so-called Fuzzy Attribute Simplification Logic. This logic leads to some automatic reasoning methods for implications in data with grades. As the number of graded implications mined from the fuzzy formal context is huge and with a high degree of redundancy, the objective is to obtain a equivalent set without redundancy, by applying the rules of our logic. Finally, we approach the medical diagnosis problem in datasets with graded attributes using FASL to obtain a CDSS system, being able to offer the expert a recommendation about the diagnosis process. We propose to use SLFD attribute closure algorithm as the engine for the recommendation system based on features (symptoms, phenotypes, signs) of the items (diseases) in the dataset.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

Particularly, an explanation of the energy function when the capacity is exceeded: the limitation in pattern storage implies that similar patterns are going to be identified by the network, therefore forming different clusters. This ability can be translated as an unsupervised learning of pattern clusters, with one major advantage over most clustering algorithms: the number of data classes is automatically learned, as confirmed by the experiments. Two methods to reinforce learning are proposed to improve the quality of the clustering, by enhancing the learning of patterns relationships. As a related issue, a study on the net capacity, depending on the number of neurons and possible outputs, is presented, and some interesting conclusions are commented.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

We hypothesize that noiseless images follow Benford’s law, that is, the probability distribution of the first digit of the image values is logarithmic. We show that this is true when we consider the raw acquired image in the frequency domain. Two measures are then used to quantify the (dis)similarity between the actual distribution of the first digits and the more theoretical Benford’s law: the Bhattacharyya coefficient and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. By means of these measures, we show that the amount of noise directly affects the distribution of the first digits, thereby making it deviate from Benford’s law. In addition, in this work, these findings are used to design a method to estimate the amount of Rician noise in an image. The utilization of supervised machine learning techniques (linear regression, polynomial regression, and random forest) allows predicting the parameters of the Rician noise distribution using the dissimilarity between the measured distribution and Benford’s law as the input variable for the regression. In our experiments, testing over magnetic resonance images of 75 individuals from four different repositories, we empirically show that these techniques are able to precisely estimate the noise level present in the test T1 images.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

    "text": "The work Detection of unfavourable urban areas with higher temperatures and lack of green spaces using satellite imagery in sixteen Spanish cities has been published in Urban Forestry & Urban Greening, vol. 78, 127783.\nAbstract:\nThis paper seeks to identify the most unfavourable areas of a city in terms of high temperatures and the absence of green infrastructure. An automatic methodology based on remote sensing and data analysis has been developed and applied in sixteen Spanish cities with different characteristics. Landsat-8 satellite images were selected for each city from the July-August period of 2019 and 2020 to calculate the spatial variation of land surface temperature (LST). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to determine the abundance of vegetation across the city. Based on the NDVI and LST maps created, a k-means unsupervised classification clustering was performed to automatically identify the different clusters according to how favourable these areas were in terms of temperature and presence of vegetation. A Disadvantaged Area Index (DAI), combining both variables, was developed to produce a map showing the most unfavourable areas for each city. Overall, the percentage of the area susceptible to improvement with more vegetation in the cities studied ranged from 13 % in Huesca to 64–65 % in Bilbao and Valencia. The influence of several factors, such as the presence of water bodies or large buildings, is discussed. Detecting unfavourable areas is a very interesting tool for defining future planning strategy for green spaces.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

In a preliminary paper, we define a new kind of attribute implications to represent the knowledge from the information currently available. The whole FCA framework has to be appropriately extended to manage unknown information. This paper introduces a new logic for reasoning with this kind of implications, which belongs to the family of logics with an underlying Simplification paradigm. Specifically, we introduce a new algebra, named weak dual Heyting Algebra, that allows us to extend the Simplification logic for these new implications. To provide a solid framework, we also prove its soundness and completeness and show the advantages of the Simplification paradigm. Finally, to allow further use of this extension of FCA in applications, an algorithm for automated reasoning, which is directly built from logic, is defined.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

Therefore, a new algorithm based on a competitive Hopfield network is developed for automatic computation in the kinematic chain isomorphism problem.

Así, lo que en realidad se produce es el aprendizaje no supervisado de clases de patrones. De esta forma mediante la generalización del aprendizaje hebbiano aquí mostrado, pueden aprenderse grupos de patrones (conceptos) en lugar de patrones individuales y esto ocurre generalmente cuando se sobrepasa la capacidad de la red.

This framework allows us to obtain theoretical insight as well as algorithms on a general level and observe their special cases by choosing various types of parameterizations. This way, we study methods for automated reasoning with different types of if–then rules in a single framework that covers existing as well as novel types of rules. Our approach supports a large family of if–then rules, including fuzzy if–then rules with various types of semantics. The main results in this article include new observations on the syntactic inference of if–then rules, complete collections of rules, reduced normal forms of collections of rules, and automated reasoning methods.

Simplification logic (SL) has proved to be valuable for the study of attribute implications in a concept lattice, a topic of interest in the more general framework of formal concept analysis (FCA). Specifically, SL has become the kernel of automated methods to remove redundancy or obtain different types of bases of implications. Although originally FCA used only the positive information contained in the dataset, negative information (explicitly stating that an attribute does not hold) has been proposed by several authors, but without an adequate set of equivalence-preserving rules for simplification. In this work, we propose a mixed simplification logic and a method to automatically remove redundancy in implications, which will serve as a foundational standpoint for the automated reasoning methods for this extended framework.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

The enumeration of all the closed sets and their minimal generators from a set of rules or implications constitutes a complex problem, drawing an exponential cost. Even for small datasets, such representation can demand an exhaustive management of the information stored as attribute implications. In this work, we tackle this problem by merging two strategies. On the one hand, we design a pruning, strongly based on logic properties, to drastically reduce the search space of the method. On the other hand, we consider a parallelization of the problem leading to a massive computation by means of a map-reduce like paradigm. In this study we have characterized the type of search space reductions suitable for parallelization. Also, we have analyzed different situations to provide an orientation of the resources (number of cores) needed for both the parallel architecture and the size of the problem in the splitting stage to take advantage in the map stage.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

    "text": "The work Revisiting Algorithms for Fuzzy Concept Lattices has been published in the 16th International Conference on Concept Lattices and Applications 2022.\nAbstract:\nA central notion in Formal Concept Analysis is the concept lattice. This lattice allows describing a hierarchical biclustering between objects and attributes of a formal context, whose hierarchy is defined by an order that expresses the specialisation-generalisation relationship between concepts. It is a fundamental way of representing the knowledge implicit in the context. Therefore, in practice, due to its theoretical complexity, it is necessary to define computationally efficient algorithms for its calculation. In the literature, several algorithms, using different approaches, have been proposed for the computation of the lattice in the classical framework, where the presence of an attribute in an object is modelled as a binary value, indicating that the attribute is either present or absent. However, it is possible to extend this framework to take into account the different degrees to which an attribute could be present in an object. Through this extension, it is possible to model fuzzy situations where the attribute is not 100% present in an object, giving flexibility to the model. In this paper, we review some of the best known algorithms for the calculation of the concept lattice in the binary version, and we extend them for the calculation of the fuzzy concept lattice, presenting the most significant differences with respect to the original binary versions. In addition, we will present examples of the execution of these new versions of the algorithms.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

However, SOM has two main drawbacks: the static architecture and the lack of representation of hierarchical relations among input data. The growing hierarchical SOM (GHSOM) was proposed in order to face these difficulties. The network architecture is adapted during the learning process and provides an intuitive representation of the hierarchical relations of the data. Some limitations of this model are the static topology of the maps (2-D grids) and the big amount of neurons created without necessity. A growing hierarchical self-organizing graph (GHSOG) based on the GHSOM is presented. The maps are graphs instead of 2-D rectangular grids, where the neurons are considered the vertices, and each edge of the graph represents a neighborhood relation between neurons. This new approach provides greater plasticity and a more flexible architecture, where the neurons arrangement is not restricted to a fixed topology, achieving a more faithfully data representation. The proposed neural model has been used to build an Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), where experimental results confirm its good performance.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

Particularly, an explanation of the energy function when the capacity is exceeded: the limitation in pattern storage implies that similar patterns are going to be identified by the network, therefore forming different clusters.\nThis ability can be translated as an unsupervised learning of pattern clusters, with one major advantage over most clustering algorithms: the number of data classes is automatically learned, as confirmed by the experiments. Two methods to reinforce learning are proposed to improve the quality of the clustering, by enhancing the learning of patterns relationships.\nAs a related issue, a study on the net capacity, depending on the number of neurons and possible outputs, is presented, and some interesting conclusions are commented.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

    "text": "The work Mining Fuzzy Concept Lattices has been published in the 22nd International Conference on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering 2022.\nAbstract:\nOne of the ways to represent the implicit knowledge in a binary dataset under the paradigm of Formal Concept Analysis is the concept lattice. This lattice allows describing a hierarchical biclustering between objects and attributes of a formal context. Concepts are the fixed points of a Galois connection, describing a closure system. In practice, the computation of such lattice presents a high complexity, the number of concepts can be exponential in the size of the input context. Therefore, there is interest in developing new algorithms that take advantage of the lattice structure to efficiently compute the concept set. Thus, many algorithms have been proposed to compute the concept lattice in this binary setting in the last years. To avoid the complete enumeration of subsets to check which of them are closed, some pruning strategies have been proposed. For example, the NextClosure algorithm defines a lectic order in which to explore closed sets. Other strategies are based on a recursive tree search accompanied by canonicity tests that allow a more efficient exploration. Those based on the CbO strategy, such as FastCbO (FCbO), or InClose stand out. It is possible to extend this framework to take into account the different degrees to which an attribute could be present in an object. Through this extension, it is possible to model fuzzy situations where the attribute is not 100% present in an object, giving flexibility to the model. In this paper, we extend the previous algorithms for the calculation of the fuzzy concept lattice. We show how the InClose family of algorithms can be extended from the binary setting to the fuzzy one, detailing the differences and how new canonicity tests can be employed in order to reduce the computational cost of determining the set of concepts. We show that these new algorithms can compete with the state of the art in terms of execution time and in number of operations performed. These algorithms may open a new research line in which optimised algorithms can be deduced and built ad hoc for the computation of the fuzzy concept lattice.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

The recommender system has been used to provide differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and schizoaffective and bipolar disorders.

In particular, this paper is focused in giving solutions to the two main problems present in the model: the apparition of spurious patterns in the learning phase (implying the well-known and undesirable effect of storing the opposite pattern) and the problem of its reduced capacity (the probability of error in the retrieving phase increases as the number of stored patterns grows). In this work, a method to avoid spurious patterns is presented and studied, and an explanation to the previously mentioned effect is given. Another novel technique to increase the capacity of a network is proposed here, based on the idea of using several reference points when storing patterns. It is studied in depth, and an explicit formula for the capacity of the network is provided. This formula shows the linear dependence of the capacity of the new model on the number of reference points, implying the increase of the capacity in mis model. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

In this formal framework, based on lattice theory and logic, we can build a lattice where threat sets are organised hierarchically according to specialisation-generalisation criteria, which provides us with a direct approach to setting up a unified taxonomy of malware.\nOn the other hand, the use of FCA itself enables the discovery of logical rules and the application of automated reasoning methods whose objective is to simplify the detection process without losing information or threat detection capacity and even increasing this capacity.\nIn this sense, our proposal differs from previous ones in that it does not use statistical criteria, but rather an exhaustive analysis and mathematical modelling of the knowledge contained in malware databases, so that the models obtained are based on logical and algebraic tools and offer a greater degree of interpretability and explainability than previous proposals.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

This paper reveals their adherence to Benford’s law, characterized by a logarithmic distribution of first digits. The impact of Rician noise on the first digit distribution is examined, which causes deviations from the ideal distribution. A novel methodology is proposed for noise level estimation, employing metrics such as the Bhattacharyya distance, Kullback–Leibler divergence, total variation distance, Hellinger distance, and Jensen–Shannon divergence. Supervised learning techniques utilize these metrics as regressors. Evaluations on MRI scans from several datasets coming from a wide range of different acquisition devices of 1.5 T and 3 T, comprising hundreds of patients, validate the adherence of noiseless T1 MRI frequency domain coefficients to Benford’s law. Through rigorous experimentation, our methodology has demonstrated competitiveness with established noise estimation techniques, even surpassing them in numerous conducted experiments.

One of the problems to be faced is the lack of enough resolution, which makes fine details of the brain inappreciable. Image Super-Resolution (SR) intends to solve an ill-posed problem to increase its resolution. The first approaches were based on the frequency and the spatial domain, extrapolating the high-frequency information from the low-resolution (LR) image, or regularization strategies, incorporating the prior knowledge of the unknown high-resolution (HR) image. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) has become the most competitive method to perform SR. Many models have been developed to enhance 2D slices only instead of using the 3D spatial information. This chapter begins with an introduction to the SR problem and goes over traditional and deep neural network models for 3D MR super-resolution.

    "text": "The work An approach to artificial concept learning based on human concept learning by using artificial neural networks has been published in Advancing Artificial Intelligence Through Biological Process Applications, pp. 130-145.\nAbstract:\nIn this chapter, two important issues concerning associative memory by neural networks are studied: a new model of hebbian learning, as well as the effect of the network capacity when retrieving patterns and performing clustering tasks. Particularly, an explanation of the energy function when the capacity is exceeded: the limitation in pattern storage implies that similar patterns are going to be identified by the network, therefore forming different clusters. This ability can be translated as an unsupervised learning of pattern clusters, with one major advantage over most clustering algorithms: the number of data classes is automatically learned, as confirmed by the experiments. Two methods to reinforce learning are proposed to improve the quality of the clustering, by enhancing the learning of patterns relationships. As a related issue, a study on the net capacity, depending on the number of neurons and possible outputs, is presented, and some interesting conclusions are commented.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

    "text": "The work Aggregation Functions and Extent Structure Preservation in Formal Concept Analysis has been published in International Conference on Conceptual Structures, LNCS 14133, pp. 28–35,.\nAbstract:\nFormal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for analysing data tables that capture the relationship between objects and attributes. The concept lattice derived from such a table is a representation of the implicit knowledge about this relationship, where each concept corresponds to a bicluster of objects and attributes. FCA has been widely used for knowledge acquisition and representation, conceptual data analysis, information retrieval and other applications. In this paper, we use an extension of the classical FCA to deal with fuzzy formal contexts, where the relationship between objects and attributes is modelled by truth values indicating the degree to which an object possesses a property or attribute. Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA) allows us to capture vague or imprecise information and handle uncertainty or ambiguity in data analysis. Our purpose is to use aggregation functions in order to manipulate and explore fuzzy formal concepts in different ways depending on the desired properties or criteria. In this work, we will focus on the structure of the extents of the concept lattice. We define the aggregation of fuzzy extents point-wise and study how it affects its structure. We characterise the aggregation functions that preserve the fuzzy extent structure and show that they depend on the number of objects in the context. Our results contribute to a better understanding of how aggregation functions can be used to manipulate and explore fuzzy formal concepts.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

In this way, you can get an early diagnosis of the disease. We have used 2100 structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI), classified by sex (1097 M/1003 F), and corresponding to healthy people (C, Controls) and with Dementia (AD, Alzheimer’s Disease), between 18 and 96 años (M-C 59.44±24, F-C 60.75±22.79/ M-AD 75.35±7.07, F-C 74.23±8.02), from public domain databases. The SMRI processing methodology uses filtering, segmentation algorithms, and the calculation of parameters such as cortical thickness or volume. Furthermore, registration was performed on each subject with a standard template and a 116 anatomical structures atlas in which the above parameters are calculated. It was possible to establish which structural changes the brain undergoes when affected by Alzheimer’s disease, according to criteria of loss of volume or gray matter thickness, relative to healthy subjects paracentral lobe, angular gyrus, calcarine sulcus (p&lt;0.001), among others. some rules Have also been developed for classifying (error &lt;9%) a given subject as normal or with Alzheimer with a given probability. We generated a model of Alzheimer’s disease, using statistical techniques and imaging processing. This study shows the brain areas that atrophy faster with the disease, and in what sequence they do.\nFor more details on this work, visit its own page."

    "text": "Abstract\nMagnetic Resonance (MR) has a paramount dependence on the acquisition process, sometimes generating low-quality images useless for clinical diagnosis. One of the problems to be faced is the lack of enough resolution, which makes fine details of the brain inappreciable. Image Super-Resolution (SR) intends to solve an ill-posed problem to increase its resolution. The first approaches were based on the frequency and the spatial domain, extrapolating the high-frequency information from the low-resolution (LR) image, or regularization strategies, incorporating the prior knowledge of the unknown high-resolution (HR) image. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) has become the most competitive method to perform SR. Many models have been developed to enhance 2D slices only instead of using the 3D spatial information. This chapter begins with an introduction to the SR problem and goes over traditional and deep neural network models for 3D MR super-resolution. Finally, a compilation of the most recent methods is presented, compared quantitatively and qualitatively using the newest public datasets.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Dom+22] E.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe field of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) originated in the 1980s in Darmstadt, Germany, as a subfield of mathematical order theory, building on earlier research and developments by other groups. The original motivation for FCA was to explore complete lattices as lattices of concepts, drawing inspiration from both Philosophy and Mathematics. Over time, FCA has evolved into a broad research area with applications far beyond its initial focus, including but not limited to logic, knowledge representation, unsupervised learning, data mining, human learning, and psychology.\nThis volume features the contributions accepted for the 17th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis (ICFCA 2023), held during July 17 – 21, 2023, at University of Kassel, Germany. The International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis serves as a platform for researchers from FCA and related disciplines to showcase and exchange their research findings. Since its inaugural edition in 2003 in Darmstadt, Germany, ICFCA has been held annually in multiple locations across Europe, Africa, America, and Australia. In 2015, ICFCA became a biennial event to alternate with the Conference on Concept Lattices and Their Applications (CLA).\nThe previous edition, ICFCA 2021, organized by the Université de Strasbourg in France, was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that conditions are beginning to return to the pre-pandemic situation, this edition will once again offer face-to-face opportunities as well as an online mode for the audience, making this the first hybrid ICFCA edition.\nThis year’s ICFCA received 19 submissions from authors from ten countries. At least two different program committee members and one member of the editorial board reviewed each submission. Reviewing was done in a single-blinded fashion. Thirteen high-quality papers were selected for publication in this volume. This represents an acceptance rate of 67%.\nThe research part of this volume is divided into two distinct sections. First, in “Theory”, we have collected papers that propose and review advances in theoretical aspects of FCA. The second section, “Applications and Visualization”, consists of advances that deal with new algorithms, applications, and different approaches to visualization techniques.\nIn addition to the regular contributions, this volume also includes the abstracts of the six invited talks by outstanding researchers whom we were pleased to welcome to ICFCA 2023. In detail, we were pleased to host the following talks:\n\nHow to Visualize Sets and Set Relations by Oliver Deussen, Visual Computing, University of Konstanz, Germany\nTangles: from Wittgenstein to graph minors and back by Reinhard Diestel, Discrete Mathematics, University of Hamburg, Germany\nFormal Concept Analysis in Boolean Matrix Factorization: Algorithms and Extensions to Ordinal and Fuzzy-Valued Data by Jan Konečný, Department of Computer Science, Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic\nOn the \\varphi-degree of inclusion by Manuel Ojeda Aciego, Departmento de Matemática Aplicada, Universidad de Málaga, Spain\nLogical foundations of categorization theory by Alessandra Palmigiano, Department of Ethics, Governance and Society, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands\nModern Concepts of Dimension for Partially Ordered Sets by William T. Trotter, School of Mathematics, Georgia Tech Institute, USA\n\nMoreover, due to the recent computation of the ninth Dedekind number using techniques from FCA, this edition also includes a late-breaking result talk:\n\nBreaking the Barrier: A Computation of the Ninth Dedekind Number by Christian Jäkel, Methods of Applied Algebra, Dresden University of Technology, Germany\n\nWe are deeply grateful to all the authors who submitted their papers to ICFCA 2023 as a venue to present their work. Our sincere appreciation goes to the members of the Editorial Board and Program Committee, as well as all the additional reviewers, whose timely and thorough reviews enabled the fruitful discussions of the high quality papers during the conference. We would also like to express our gratitude to the local organizers who were always quick to solve any problems that arose.

    "text": "Abstract\nClosed sets and minimal generators are fundamental elements to build a complete knowledge representation in formal concept analysis. The enumeration of all the closed sets and their minimal generators from a set of rules or implications constitutes a complex problem, drawing an exponential cost. Even for small datasets, such representation can demand an exhaustive management of the information stored as attribute implications. In this work, we tackle this problem by merging two strategies. On the one hand, we design a pruning, strongly based on logic properties, to drastically reduce the search space of the method. On the other hand, we consider a parallelization of the problem leading to a massive computation by means of a map-reduce like paradigm. In this study we have characterized the type of search space reductions suitable for parallelization. Also, we have analyzed different situations to provide an orientation of the resources (number of cores) needed for both the parallel architecture and the size of the problem in the splitting stage to take advantage in the map stage.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Ben+19] F.

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper seeks to identify the most unfavourable areas of a city in terms of high temperatures and the absence of green infrastructure. An automatic methodology based on remote sensing and data analysis has been developed and applied in sixteen Spanish cities with different characteristics. Landsat-8 satellite images were selected for each city from the July-August period of 2019 and 2020 to calculate the spatial variation of land surface temperature (LST). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to determine the abundance of vegetation across the city. Based on the NDVI and LST maps created, a k-means unsupervised classification clustering was performed to automatically identify the different clusters according to how favourable these areas were in terms of temperature and presence of vegetation. A Disadvantaged Area Index (DAI), combining both variables, was developed to produce a map showing the most unfavourable areas for each city. Overall, the percentage of the area susceptible to improvement with more vegetation in the cities studied ranged from 13 % in Huesca to 64–65 % in Bilbao and Valencia. The influence of several factors, such as the presence of water bodies or large buildings, is discussed. Detecting unfavourable areas is a very interesting tool for defining future planning strategy for green spaces.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURSUS-DM: Nuevos desarrollos en minería de datos para su utilización en la sostenibilidad urbana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData mining\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 September 2019\n\n\nDomingo López-Rodríguez\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCites\nThe following graph plots the number of cites received by this work from its publication, on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Rod+22] F.

However, the tool is still needed in building intelligent systems for product design and manufacturing. In this paper, we design a novel multivalued neural network that enables a simplified formulation of the graph isomorphism problem.

    "text": "Abstract\nFormal concept analysis (FCA) is a solid mathematical framework to manage information based on logic and lattice theory. It defines two explicit representations of the knowledge present in a dataset as concepts and implications. This paper describes an R package called fcaR that implements FCA’s core notions and techniques. Additionally, it implements the extension of FCA to fuzzy datasets and a simplification logic to develop automated reasoning tools. This package is the first to implement FCA techniques in R. Therefore, emphasis has been put on defining classes and methods that could be reusable and extensible by the community. Furthermore, the package incorporates an interface with the arules package, probably the most used package regarding association rules, closely related to FCA. Finally, we show an application of the use of the package to design a recommender system based on logic for diagnosis in neurological pathologies.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAIR: Fuzzy, Logic and Algebraic tools for Information Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Concept Analysis\n\n\nFuzzy Logic\n\n\nUncertainty\n\n\nImprecise information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 September 2019\n\n\nManuel Ojeda Aciego, Nicolás Madrid Labrador\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCites\nThe following graph plots the number of cites received by this work from its publication, on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Cor+22] P.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a novel method to estimate the level of Rician noise in magnetic resonance images is presented. We hypothesize that noiseless images follow Benford’s law, that is, the probability distribution of the first digit of the image values is logarithmic. We show that this is true when we consider the raw acquired image in the frequency domain. Two measures are then used to quantify the (dis)similarity between the actual distribution of the first digits and the more theoretical Benford’s law: the Bhattacharyya coefficient and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. By means of these measures, we show that the amount of noise directly affects the distribution of the first digits, thereby making it deviate from Benford’s law. In addition, in this work, these findings are used to design a method to estimate the amount of Rician noise in an image. The utilization of supervised machine learning techniques (linear regression, polynomial regression, and random forest) allows predicting the parameters of the Rician noise distribution using the dissimilarity between the measured distribution and Benford’s law as the input variable for the regression. In our experiments, testing over magnetic resonance images of 75 individuals from four different repositories, we empirically show that these techniques are able to precisely estimate the noise level present in the test T1 images.\n\n\nCites\nThe following graph plots the number of cites received by this work from its publication, on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Maz+21] R.

But problems with Moodle arise in our scientific context. Although Moodle can preview LaTeX code, not all the possibilities of LaTeX are available and it is very good for scientific teachers but hard for students, so, the mathematical formulas are usually replaced by non-standard versions of them written in ASCII. Another problem with Moodle is the difficulty of reusing quizzes. We present two tools that improve Moodle in three aspects: representation of math formulas, mathematical computation, and improving the learning units for the students. WIRIS is a powerful editor and allows interacting by using mathematic formulas in an easy way and developing new learning units with mathematical computation via web; M-QIT is a new tool able to manage and reutilize quizzes and questions available in previous courses in Moodle.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[BCL10] A.

    "title": "Revisiting Algorithms for Fuzzy Concept Lattices",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nA central notion in Formal Concept Analysis is the concept lattice. This lattice allows describing a hierarchical biclustering between objects and attributes of a formal context, whose hierarchy is defined by an order that expresses the specialisation-generalisation relationship between concepts. It is a fundamental way of representing the knowledge implicit in the context. Therefore, in practice, due to its theoretical complexity, it is necessary to define computationally efficient algorithms for its calculation. In the literature, several algorithms, using different approaches, have been proposed for the computation of the lattice in the classical framework, where the presence of an attribute in an object is modelled as a binary value, indicating that the attribute is either present or absent. However, it is possible to extend this framework to take into account the different degrees to which an attribute could be present in an object. Through this extension, it is possible to model fuzzy situations where the attribute is not 100% present in an object, giving flexibility to the model. In this paper, we review some of the best known algorithms for the calculation of the concept lattice in the binary version, and we extend them for the calculation of the fuzzy concept lattice, presenting the most significant differences with respect to the original binary versions. In addition, we will present examples of the execution of these new versions of the algorithms.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects funding this work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAIR: Fuzzy, Logic and Algebraic tools for Information Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Concept Analysis\n\n\nFuzzy Logic\n\n\nUncertainty\n\n\nImprecise information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 September 2019\n\n\nManuel Ojeda Aciego, Nicolás Madrid Labrador\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[LMO22] D.

    "text": "Abstract\nA new technique based on slight modifications of the energy function of a neural network is proposed in this work. The aim of this technique is to reduce the number of local minima of the objective function, allowing the net to improve considerably the quality of the obtained solutions. Most discrete neural networks can benefit from its application, due to its generality and ease of use. We also propose its theoretical bases, and its application to recurrent neural networks is shown. To this end, Traveling Salesman Problem has been used as benchmark for this technique, as it is the best-known combinatorial optimization problem and the most used benchmark to quantify the efficiency of algorithms applied to this kind of problems. This new method has been compared to other techniques in terms of average solution quality, showing a substantial improvement. It is also able, in most of the performed simulations, to reach solutions near to global optimum.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[LM05] D. López-Rodríguez and E.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe self-organizing map (SOM) has been used in multiple areas and constitutes an excellent tool for data mining. However, SOM has two main drawbacks: the static architecture and the lack of representation of hierarchical relations among input data. The growing hierarchical SOM (GHSOM) was proposed in order to face these difficulties. The network architecture is adapted during the learning process and provides an intuitive representation of the hierarchical relations of the data. Some limitations of this model are the static topology of the maps (2-D grids) and the big amount of neurons created without necessity. A growing hierarchical self-organizing graph (GHSOG) based on the GHSOM is presented. The maps are graphs instead of 2-D rectangular grids, where the neurons are considered the vertices, and each edge of the graph represents a neighborhood relation between neurons. This new approach provides greater plasticity and a more flexible architecture, where the neurons arrangement is not restricted to a fixed topology, achieving a more faithfully data representation. The proposed neural model has been used to build an Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), where experimental results confirm its good performance.\n\n\nCites\nThe following graph plots the number of cites received by this work from its publication, on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[Pal+09] E.

    "text": "Abstract\nIn this paper, two important issues concerning pattern recognition by neural networks are studied: a new model of hebbian learning, as well as the effect of the network capacity when retrieving patterns and performing clustering tasks. Particularly, an explanation of the energy function when the capacity is exceeded: the limitation in pattern storage implies that similar patterns are going to be identified by the network, therefore forming different clusters.\nThis ability can be translated as an unsupervised learning of pattern clusters, with one major advantage over most clustering algorithms: the number of data classes is automatically learned, as confirmed by the experiments. Two methods to reinforce learning are proposed to improve the quality of the clustering, by enhancing the learning of patterns relationships.\nAs a related issue, a study on the net capacity, depending on the number of neurons and possible outputs, is presented, and some interesting conclusions are commented.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[ML05] E.

    "text": "Abstract\nIsomorphism identification between graphs is an important NP-complete problem with many science and engineering applications. Although excellent progresses have been made towards special graphs, no known polynomial-time algorithm for graph isomorphism has been found for general graphs. In this paper a generalization of the Hopfield neural network for isomorphism identification between general graphs is proposed. Simulation results show that this model is much superior to recently presented neural networks for this problem. The effectiveness of the resultant network does not seem to be decreased as the size of the graph is increased. This allows us to solve graph isomorphism problems with a big number of vertices, while many recently presented approaches only present results for graphs with up to 15 vertices.\n\n\nCitation\nPlease, cite this work as:\n[GLM08] G.

Our proposal explores how we can cluster implications. This work opens a research line to study the knowledge inside the clusters computed from the Duquenne-Guigues basis. Some alternative measures to induce the clusters are analysed, taking into account the information that directly appears in the appearance and the semantics of the implications. This work also allows us to show the fcaR package, which has the main methods of FCA and the Simplification Logic.

The adequate management of imperfect information is essential in applications, not only in Artificial Intelligence, but also in Social Sciences.\nThis proposal is determined by our long-term vision: the adequate languages for this framework should be based on the formal grounds of algebra and logic.\nAnalyzing the state-of-the-art on algebraic, logic, and fuzzy approaches to the management of imperfect information, our initial hypothesis is based on the following premises:\n\nMany real-world problems are difficult to formalize by using classical methods, and a more general formal framework is needed in which approximate reasoning and/or imperfect information comes into play.\nFurther efforts are needed on foundational research about imperfect information so that unifying approaches can be found by abstracting particular details and extracting the basic mechanisms of execution.\n\nThis foundational research has to be necessarily done on a step-by-step basis. This is why we focus on specific topics in which our research team has proven proficiency, and we propose a scheme in which we will work in parallel in several lines.\nOur long-term vision should lead to a thorough formal theory of imperfect information, and the expected breakthrough towards this aim is the development of foundations for certain selected areas of interest, namely, the study of the mathematical and logic-based approaches to imperfect information, fuzzy inference systems using F-transform and measures of inconsistency, and a case study on Digital Forensics.\n\n\nPublished works\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Discovery in Malware Datasets using Formal Concept Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\n14th European Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n5 October 2022\n\n\nAngel Mora Bonilla, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Manuel Enciso, Pablo Cordero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfcaR, Formal Concept Analysis with R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nR package\n\n\n\nThe R Journal\n\n\n\n\n\n1 September 2022\n\n\nPablo Cordero, Manuel Enciso, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Ángel Mora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimal Generators from Positive and Negative Attributes: Analysing the Knowledge Space of a Mathematics Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nFuzzy logic\n\n\nE-learning\n\n\n\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, 15:58\n\n\n\n\n\n9 August 2022\n\n\nManuel Ojeda‐Hernández, Francisco Pérez‐Gámez, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Nicolás Madrid, Ángel Mora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing the Mixed Concept Lattice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nInternational Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n13 July 2022\n\n\nFrancisco Pérez-Gámez, Pablo Cordero, Manuel Enciso, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Angel Mora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMining Fuzzy Concept Lattices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nthe 22nd International Conference on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n4 July 2022\n\n\nManuel Ojeda-Hernández, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Ángel Mora, Pablo Cordero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfcaR, Spreading FCA to the Data Science World\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR package\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nWorkshop on Existing Tools and Applications for Formal Context Analysis 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n22 June 2022\n\n\nPablo Cordero, Manuel Enciso, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Ángel Mora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisiting Algorithms for Fuzzy Concept Lattices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nthe 16th International Conference on Concept Lattices and Applications 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n21 June 2022\n\n\nDomingo López-Rodríguez, Ángel Mora, Manuel Ojeda-Hernández\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplifying Implications with Positive and Negative Attributes: A Logic-Based Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nFuzzy logic\n\n\n\nMathematics, 10(4) 607\n\n\n\n\n\n16 February 2022\n\n\nFrancisco Pérez-Gámez, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Pablo Cordero, Ángel Mora, Manuel Ojeda-Aciego\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal methods in FCA and Big Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nBig data\n\n\n\nComplex Data Analytics with Formal Concept Analysis, pp. 201 – 224\n\n\n\n\n\n8 December 2021\n\n\nDomingo López Rodríguez, Emilio Muñoz Velasco, Manuel Ojeda Aciego\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic Modelling in Social Networks with Formal Concept Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nText mining\n\n\n\nInternational Conference on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering (CMMSE) 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n20 July 2021\n\n\nP.

En este sentido, la aplicación de técnicas de Ciencia de Datos es muy conveniente para la extracción de conocimiento implícito en los cursos de enseñanza semi-presencial como el que usamos en nuestra Universidad (Moodle).\nEl uso de técnicas tales como agrupamiento, regresión, series temporales, etc, para la extracción de reglas entre datos educacionales, permiten visualizar importantes patrones que detecten deficiencias o vislumbren posibles mejoras en las herramientas de evaluación utilizadas en los cursos Moodle.\nEn esta propuesta se pretende desarrollar una herramienta usando el lenguaje R que, tomando como entrada las tablas Moodle de calificación, resumen de actividades y trabajode los alumnos, aplique técnicas computacionales para detectar patrones reales de dependencia entre contenidos y mejorar el proceso enseñanza-aprendizaje en las asignaturas de matemáticas en las que impartimos docencia.\nLa herramienta desarrollada, por una parte, ofrecerá al profesorado la posibilidad de generar actividades adaptadas al nivel de los distintos grupos de alumnos; por otra parte, extraerá reglas a partir de los patrones de dependencia de contenidos para analizar el proceso de aprendizaje en función de las actividades propuestas.\nEste análisis permitirá detectar los conceptos y habilidades clave con mayor repercusión en la adquisición de las competencias fundamentales para alcanzar los resultados de aprendizaje esperados y, de esta forma, replantear el proceso enseñanza-aprendizaje para hacer hincapié en tales aspectos.\n\n\nPublished works\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimal Generators from Positive and Negative Attributes: Analysing the Knowledge Space of a Mathematics Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nFuzzy logic\n\n\nE-learning\n\n\n\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, 15:58\n\n\n\n\n\n9 August 2022\n\n\nManuel Ojeda‐Hernández, Francisco Pérez‐Gámez, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Nicolás Madrid, Ángel Mora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Logic to Determine Key Items in Math Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-learning\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\nFuzzy logic\n\n\n\nIADIS International Conference e-Learning 2021 (part of MCCSIS 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n20 July 2021\n\n\nManuel Ojeda-Hernández, Francisco Pérez-Gámez, Ángel Mora Bonilla, Domingo López-Rodríguez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Formal Concept Analysis to Explore Hidden Knowledge in the Assessment of a Math Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-learning\n\n\nFormal concept analysis\n\n\n\nIADIS International Conference e-Learning 2020 (part of MCCSIS 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n22 July 2020\n\n\nFrancisco Pérez-Gámez, Manuel Ojeda-Hernández, Ángel Mora Bonilla, Domingo López-Rodríguez, Nicolas Madrid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
