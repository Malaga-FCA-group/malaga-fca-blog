The work <u>Lexicon-based sentiment analysis in texts using Formal Concept Analysis</u> has been published in <em><em>International Journal of Approximate Reasoning</em>, vol. 155, pp 104-112</em>.

<u>Abstract</u>:



In this paper, we present a novel approach for sentiment analysis that uses Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to create dictionaries for classification. Unlike other methods that rely on pre-defined lexicons, our approach allows for the creation of customised dictionaries that are tailored to the specific data and tasks. By using a dataset of tweets categorised into positive and negative polarity, we show that our approach achieves a better performance than other standard dictionaries.
