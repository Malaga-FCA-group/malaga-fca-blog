The work <u>Enhanced maxcut clustering with multivalued neural networks and functional annealing</u> has been published in <em>ESANN 2006 Proceedings - 14th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, <em>pp. 25&ndash;30</em></em>.

<u>Abstract</u>:



In this work a new algorithm to improve the performance of optimization methods, by means of avoiding certain local optima, is described. Its theoretical bases are presented in a rigorous, but intuitive, way. It has been applied concretely to the case of recurrent neural networks, in particular to MREM, a multivalued recurrent model, that has proved to obtain very good results when dealing with NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems. In order to show its efficiency, the well-known MaxCut problem for graphs has been selected as benchmark. Our proposal outperforms other specialized and powerful techniques, as shown by simulations.
