The work <u>Topic Modelling in Social Networks with Formal Concept Analysis</u> has been published in <em>International Conference on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering (CMMSE) 2021</em>.

<u>Abstract</u>:



In the age of social networks, the amount of the written material published
  every day exceeds our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organise and
  to understand extensive collections of unstructured text documents. In machine learning
  and natural language processing, a topic model is a statistical model for discovering
  the abstract ''topics'' in a collection of documents, uncovering hidden semantic
  structures and clusters of similar words. Topic modelling formalises this idea mathematically
  in a framework that allows discovering the topics and each document''s balance of
  topics. One of the first topic models was latent semantic indexing. Later, the probabilistic
  latent semantic analysis (PLSA) was presented, serving as a basis for many others.
  Notably, its extension latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is one of the most common
  topic model currently in use. To approach topic modelling in social networks, we
  use Formal Concept Analysis, a mathematical tool firmly based on lattice theory
  and logic. Our approach uses the knowledge contained in the concept lattice to extract
  the topics. Thus, this approach to topic modelling is not statistical. For example,
  we do not need to assume a prior distribution of terms. Instead, the actual data
  structure is used to infer the semantic relationships between attributes. The procedure
  is as follows: a formal context is built from the document-term matrix of the set
  of documents. Then, we use FCA tools to construct the concept lattice that contains,
  in each concept, knowledge about the topics in the documents. Once this lattice
  is built, the concepts are clustered. Concept clusters are then used to induce topic
  models on the original documents. An experiment with a dataset with tweets about
  some hashtags is conducted with our approach to show how Formal Concept Analysis
  can be used in Social Network Analysis. In addition, a comparison with classical
  techniques is being addressed.
