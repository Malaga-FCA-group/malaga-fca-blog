The work <u>Mining Fuzzy Concept Lattices</u> has been published in <em>the <em>22nd International Conference on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering 2022</em></em>.

<u>Abstract</u>:



One of the ways to represent the implicit knowledge in a binary dataset
  under the paradigm of Formal Concept Analysis is the concept lattice. This lattice
  allows describing a hierarchical biclustering between objects and attributes of
  a formal context. Concepts are the fixed points of a Galois connection, describing
  a closure system. In practice, the computation of such lattice presents a high complexity,
  the number of concepts can be exponential in the size of the input context. Therefore,
  there is interest in developing new algorithms that take advantage of the lattice
  structure to efficiently compute the concept set. Thus, many algorithms have been
  proposed to compute the concept lattice in this binary setting in the last years.
  To avoid the complete enumeration of subsets to check which of them are closed,
  some pruning strategies have been proposed. For example, the NextClosure algorithm
  defines a lectic order in which to explore closed sets. Other strategies are based
  on a recursive tree search accompanied by canonicity tests that allow a more efficient
  exploration. Those based on the CbO strategy, such as FastCbO (FCbO), or InClose
  stand out. It is possible to extend this framework to take into account the different
  degrees to which an attribute could be present in an object. Through this extension,
  it is possible to model fuzzy situations where the attribute is not 100% present
  in an object, giving flexibility to the model. In this paper, we extend the previous
  algorithms for the calculation of the fuzzy concept lattice. We show how the InClose
  family of algorithms can be extended from the binary setting to the fuzzy one, detailing
  the differences and how new canonicity tests can be employed in order to reduce
  the computational cost of determining the set of concepts. We show that these new
  algorithms can compete with the state of the art in terms of execution time and
  in number of operations performed. These algorithms may open a new research line
  in which optimised algorithms can be deduced and built ad hoc for the computation
  of the fuzzy concept lattice.
