  abstract: One of the hot topics in  clinical research is  hidden knowledge discovery  in
    datasets with a high number of features (variables or attributes). We approach
    how to provide recommendations in Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) to
    guide the experts in the diagnostic process. The dataset used for this work is
    an openly sharing neuroimaging data from 1100 subjects with 162 graded attributes,
    that is, features with a degree of certainty. The knowledge retrieved from the
    dataset is shaped like graded implications which will be manipulated using  some
    automated methods based on logic. These methods guide the experts in the diagnostic
    process  establishing a recommendation. In this paper, we work under the Fuzzy
    Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) framework. The first result is the mining of the
    graded implications from the dataset using the NEXTCLOSURE for Graded Attributes.
    The problem of reasoning with these graded implications is approached with  the
    so-called  Fuzzy Attribute Simplification Logic. This logic leads to some automatic
    reasoning methods for implications in data with grades. As the number of graded
    implications mined from the fuzzy formal context is huge and with a high degree
    of redundancy, the objective is to obtain a equivalent set without redundancy,
    by applying the rules of our logic.  Finally, we approach the medical diagnosis
    problem in datasets with graded attributes using FASL to obtain a CDSS system,
    being able to offer the expert a recommendation about the diagnosis process.  We
    propose to use SLFD attribute closure algorithm as the engine for the recommendation
    system based on features (symptoms, phenotypes, signs) of the items (diseases)
    in the dataset.

  abstract: 'In the age of social networks, the amount of the written material published
    every day exceeds our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organise and
    to understand extensive collections of unstructured text documents. In machine
    learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a statistical model
    for discovering the abstract ''topics'' in a collection of documents, uncovering
    hidden semantic structures and clusters of similar words. Topic modelling formalises
    this idea mathematically in a framework that allows discovering the topics and
    each document''s balance of topics. One of the first topic models was latent semantic
    indexing. Later, the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) was presented,
    serving as a basis for many others. Notably, its extension latent Dirichlet allocation
    (LDA) is one of the most common topic model currently in use. To approach topic
    modelling in social networks, we use Formal Concept Analysis, a mathematical tool
    firmly based on lattice theory and logic. Our approach uses the knowledge contained
    in the concept lattice to extract the topics. Thus, this approach to topic modelling
    is not statistical. For example, we do not need to assume a prior distribution
    of terms. Instead, the actual data structure is used to infer the semantic relationships
    between attributes. The procedure is as follows: a formal context is built from
    the document-term matrix of the set of documents. Then, we use FCA tools to construct
    the concept lattice that contains, in each concept, knowledge about the topics
    in the documents. Once this lattice is built, the concepts are clustered. Concept
    clusters are then used to induce topic models on the original documents. An experiment
    with a dataset with tweets about some hashtags is conducted with our approach
    to show how Formal Concept Analysis can be used in Social Network Analysis. In
    addition, a comparison with classical techniques is being addressed.'

  abstract: FCA exhaustively uses the notion of cluster by grouping attributes and
    objects and providing a solid algebraic structure to them through the concept
    lattice. Our proposal explores how we can cluster implications.  This work opens
    a research line to study the knowledge inside the clusters computed from the Duquenne-Guigues
    basis. Some alternative measures to induce the clusters are analysed, taking into
    account the information that directly appears in the appearance  and the semantics
    of the implications.  This work also allows us to show the fcaR package,   which
    has the main methods of FCA and the Simplification Logic.  The paper ends with
    a motivation of the potential applications of performing clustering on the implications.

  abstract: A central notion in Formal Concept Analysis is the concept lattice. This
    lattice allows describing a hierarchical biclustering between objects and attributes
    of a formal context, whose hierarchy is defined by an order that expresses the
    specialisation-generalisation relationship between concepts. It is a fundamental
    way of representing the knowledge implicit in the context. Therefore, in practice,
    due to its theoretical complexity, it is necessary to define computationally efficient
    algorithms for its calculation. In the literature, several algorithms, using different
    approaches, have been proposed for the computation of the lattice in the classical
    framework, where the presence of an attribute in an object is modelled as a binary
    value, indicating that the attribute is either present or absent. However, it
    is possible to extend this framework to take into account the different degrees
    to which an attribute could be present in an object. Through this extension, it
    is possible to model fuzzy situations where the attribute is not 100% present
    in an object, giving flexibility to the model. In this paper, we review some of
    the best known algorithms for the calculation of the concept lattice in the binary
    version, and we extend them for the calculation of the fuzzy concept lattice,
    presenting the most significant differences with respect to the original binary
    versions. In addition, we will present examples of the execution of these new
    versions of the algorithms.

  abstract: One of the ways to represent the implicit knowledge in a binary dataset
    under the paradigm of Formal Concept Analysis is the concept lattice. This lattice
    allows describing a hierarchical biclustering between objects and attributes of
    a formal context. Concepts are the fixed points of a Galois connection, describing
    a closure system. In practice, the computation of such lattice presents a high
    complexity, the number of concepts can be exponential in the size of the input
    context. Therefore, there is interest in developing new algorithms that take advantage
    of the lattice structure to efficiently compute the concept set. Thus, many algorithms
    have been proposed to compute the concept lattice in this binary setting in the
    last years. To avoid the complete enumeration of subsets to check which of them
    are closed, some pruning strategies have been proposed. For example, the NextClosure
    algorithm defines a lectic order in which to explore closed sets. Other strategies
    are based on a recursive tree search accompanied by canonicity tests that allow
    a more efficient exploration. Those based on the CbO strategy, such as FastCbO
    (FCbO), or InClose stand out. It is possible to extend this framework to take
    into account the different degrees to which an attribute could be present in an
    object. Through this extension, it is possible to model fuzzy situations where
    the attribute is not 100% present in an object, giving flexibility to the model.
    In this paper, we extend the previous algorithms for the calculation of the fuzzy
    concept lattice. We show how the InClose family of algorithms can be extended
    from the binary setting to the fuzzy one, detailing the differences and how new
    canonicity tests can be employed in order to reduce the computational cost of
    determining the set of concepts. We show that these new algorithms can compete
    with the state of the art in terms of execution time and in number of operations
    performed. These algorithms may open a new research line in which optimised algorithms
    can be deduced and built ad hoc for the computation of the fuzzy concept lattice.

    The classical approach on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) extracts knowledge from a binary table $K = (G, M, I)$ taking into account the existing relationships (given by the binary relation I) between objects G and attributes M. Thus, this classical setting accounts only for positive information. Particularly, FCA allows to define and compute the concept lattice $B(K)$ from this positive information. As an extension of this framework, some works consider not only this positive information, but also the negative information that is explicit when objects have no relation to specific attributes (denoted by $K$). These works, therefore, use the apposition of positive and negative information to compute the mixed concept lattice $B^{\#}(K)$. In this paper, we propose to establish the relationships between extents and intents of concepts in $B(K)$, $B(\overline{K})$ and $B^{\#}(K)$ and how to address an incremental algorithm to compute $B^{\#}(K)$ merging the knowledge on $B(K)$, $B(\overline{K})$ previously obtained with classical methods.

  abstract: Graded implications in the framework of Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis

    Conversational recommender systems have proven to be a good approach in telemedicine,
    building a dialogue between the user and the recommender based on user preferences
    provided at each step of the conversation. Here, we propose a conversational recommender
    system for medical diagnosis using fuzzy logic. Specifically, fuzzy implications
    in the framework of Formal Concept Analysis are used to store the knowledge about
    symptoms and diseases and Fuzzy Simplification Logic is selected as an appropriate
    engine to guide the conversation to a final diagnosis. The recommender system
    has been used to provide differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and schizoaffective
    and bipolar disorders. In addition, we have enriched the conversational strategy
    with two strategies (namely critiquing and elicitation mechanism) for a better
    understanding of the knowledge-driven conversation, allowing user’s feedback in
    each step of the conversation and improving the performance of the method.

    items providing new relevant information that is not evident without the use of
    the proposed tools.

  abstract: Concepts and implications are two facets of the knowledge contained within
    a binary relation between objects and attributes. Simplification logic (SL) has
    proved to be valuable for the study of attribute implications in a concept lattice,
    a topic of interest in the more general framework of formal concept analysis (FCA).
    Specifically, SL has become the kernel of automated methods to remove redundancy
    or obtain different types of bases of implications. Although originally FCA used
    only the positive information contained in the dataset, negative information (explicitly
    stating that an attribute does not hold) has been proposed by several authors,
    but without an adequate set of equivalence-preserving rules for simplification.
    In this work, we propose a mixed simplification logic and a method to automatically
    remove redundancy in implications, which will serve as a foundational standpoint
    for the automated reasoning methods for this extended framework.

    Additionally, it implements the extension of FCA to fuzzy datasets and a simplification
    logic to develop automated reasoning tools. This package is the first to implement
    FCA techniques in R. Therefore, emphasis has been put on defining classes and
    methods that could be reusable and extensible by the community. Furthermore, the
    package incorporates an interface with the arules package, probably the most used
    package regarding association rules, closely related to FCA. Finally, we show
    an application of the use of the package to design a recommender system based
    on logic for diagnosis in neurological pathologies.
